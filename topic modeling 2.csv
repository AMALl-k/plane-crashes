1,1,"Background: Pesticide exposure has been linked to some autoimmune diseases and colorectal cancer, possibly via alteration of gut microbiota or other mechanisms. While pesticides have been linked to gut dysbiosis and inflammation in animal models, few epidemiologic studies have examined pesticides in relation to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Objectives: We evaluated use of pesticides and incident IBD in 68,480 eligible pesticide applicators and spouses enrolled in the Agricultural Health Study. Methods: Self-reported IBD cases were identified from follow-up questionnaires between enrollment (1993-1997) and 2022. We evaluated IBD incidence in relation to self-reported ever use of 50 pesticides among applicators and spouses. We also explored associations with intensity-weighted lifetime days (IWLD) of pesticide use among male applicators. Covariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Cox regression. Results: We identified 454 IBD cases, including 227 among male applicators. In analyses with applicators and spouses combined, associations were positive (HR > 1.2) for ever vs. never use of five organochlorine insecticides, three organophosphate insecticides, one fungicide, and five herbicides. HRs were highest for dieldrin (HR = 1.59, 95%CI: 1.03, 2.44), toxaphene (HR = 1.61, 95%CI: 1.17, 2.21), parathion (HR = 1.42, 95%CI: 1.03, 1.95), and terbufos (HR = 1.53, 95%CI: 1.19, 1.96). We had limited power in many IWLD of pesticide use analyses and did not find clear evidence of exposure-response trends; however, we observed elevated HRs in all tertiles of IWLD use of terbufos compared to never use (T1 vs. never use HR = 1.52, 95%CI: 1.03, 2.24; T2 vs. never use HR = 1.53, 95%CI: 1.04, 2.26; T3 vs. never use HR = 1.51, 95%CI: 1.03, 2.23). Conclusions: Exposure to specific pesticides was associated with elevated hazards of IBD. These findings may have public health importance given the widespread use of pesticides and the limited number of known modifiable environmental risk factors for IBD."

This study presents a novel pesticide transport module for the OpenLISEM runoff and erosion model. During water erosion events, high amounts of pesticides can be transported alongside the runoff. Simulating this process helps to mitigate adverse effects of pesticides in the environment. We conceptualized pesticide uptake during runoff with a mixing-layer, including mass transfer of dissolved pesticides into the runoff water and detachment in combination with enrichment of sorbed pesticides. Lateral transport of pesticides is modelled with a kinematic wave based on the overland flow of water. The model simulations were in line with observations for two events in a small agricultural catchment in South-Limburg, the Netherlands. A sensitivity analysis showed that pesticide transport was mainly influenced by the mass transfer rate, the soil-water partitioning and the exponent for the enrichment ratio. The accurate simulation of runoff and erosion by OpenLISEM, enables OpenLISEM-pesticide to simulate transport and redistribution adequately."

1. Introduction
Understanding the fate of pesticides in the environment and their effect on off-site ecosystems is needed to prevent further pollution and to mitigate current adverse effects of pesticides in our environment (Lykogianni et al., 2021). The environmental fate of pesticides starts after their application on the crop and field, in which part of the pesticides can be transported to off-site areas through runoff (Kalyabina et al., 2021). In recent studies it was found that peak concentrations in streams can be directly related to rainfall events, based on evidence from a large number of agricultural headwater (<30 km2) catchments in Germany (Halbach et al., 2021). Regulatory acceptable concentrations are often exceeded for samples collected during runoff events (Vormeier et al., 2023), posing significant risks to ecosystems (Liess et al., 2021). Peak concentration of pesticides related to rainfall-runoff events are also observed in many other studies (Casado et al., 2019; laCecilia et al., 2021; Lefrancq et al., 2017a; Schönenberger et al., 2022).

These studies mainly focus on pesticides concentrations in runoff water. However, pesticides are also sorbed to soil particles and overland flow often results in surface erosion and transport of these soil particles with the runoff water. Estimated erosion rates on agricultural fields in EU are 2.5 t/ha/y on average (Panagos et al., 2015) and within the same order of magnitude for agricultural soils worldwide (Borrelli et al., 2021; Thaler et al., 2022). These rates can increase substantially depending on factors like vegetation cover, land management and local topography and climate (Panagos et al., 2015). Papers published in the past decade give an unclear picture of the contribution of sorbed pesticide transport to total pesticide transport and various studies present contradictory results (Commelin et al., 2022b). Some studies show that sorbed transport is a minor flux (Maillard et al., 2011; Napoli et al., 2016) other studies show potentially high transport of sorbed pesticides (Bento et al., 2018; Climent et al., 2019; Melland et al., 2016). In a previous field study in which we investigated sorbed and dissolved transport during rainfall-runoff events in a small agricultural catchment in South-Limburg, results showed that sorbed pesticide transport often contributes substantially to total pesticide transport, although variation between events is large (Commelin et al., 2022a). Considering both sorbed and dissolved pesticide transport during rainfall-runoff events is thus important.

Pesticide transport at the headwater catchment scale is highly influenced by catchment heterogeneity (Payraudeau and Gregoire, 2012), including hydrologic connectivity and spatiotemporal variability depending on rainfall characteristics, soil properties and landscape elements such as tillage roughness (Takken et al., 2001b), hedges and roads (Favis-Mortlock et al., 2022). Although this heterogeneity cannot be fully known or described, physical-based fully distributed models could be helpful to take into account the complexity of interacting processes during a rainfall-runoff event. Moreover they can describe alterations in land use, management or climate change and assess their impact on pesticide transport (Mottes et al., 2015; Payraudeau and Gregoire, 2012). Havis et al. (1992) developed a soil-runoff interaction model to simulate pesticide transport with dynamic runoff processes on a timescale ranging from a few seconds to minutes. The model was further implemented and tested by Joyce et al. (2010, 2008), and performed well for plot scale rainfall experiments. However, the model was not implemented in a fully distributed model on field or headwater catchment scale.

In Table 1 some commonly used pesticide fate models are compared on properties relevant for the simulation of pesticide transport during rainfall-runoff events. Several well-known models have been thoroughly tested and evaluated on pesticide leaching, degradation in the soil and transport with runoff, including for example PRZM, FOCUSPEARL, RZWQM and SWAT (DeMars et al., 2018; Purnell et al., 2020; Van den Berg et al., 2016; Young and Fry, 2019). However, the spatial representation (homogenous or hydrologic response units) and temporal scale (minimal timesteps of hours or days) of these models is not targeted at event scale dynamics. Besides these, other models have been developed, aiming at specific topics of pesticide fate. For example ZinAgriTra analyses the transport of transformation products of pesticides (Gassmann, 2013) and VFSMOD was specifically designed to predict the effect of vegetative filter strips to trap pesticides (Muñoz-Carpena et al., 2018). A fully distributed model including physical based runoff and erosion processes and related pesticide transport might contribute to a better understanding of the peak transport of pesticides during erosive rainfall-runoff events.

In a recent review 17 different models were identified that were used in the past decade to simulate the fate and transport of pesticides (Centanni et al., 2023). In most of these modelling studies particulate transport of pesticides is not taken into account due to lack of data or model limitations (e.g. Gassmann, 2013; Purnell et al., 2020; Young and Fry, 2019). When particulate transport is included, the model performance in terms of sediment transport is reported as not adequate (e.g. Chen et al., 2017; DeMars et al., 2018). Dynamics within the runoff event, and different contributing areas could not be simulated with these lumped edge-of-field models. A fully distributed dynamic model, although more complex, might be valuable in further understanding the transport processes of pesticides during erosive rainfall-runoff events. The GSSHA model does have a promising combination of properties (Pradhan et al., 2014), however very little prior research or information on applications for pesticide transport was found. A combination of the conceptual model of Havis et al. (1992) extended with particulate phase transport and the OpenLISEM model for hydrology and sediment dynamics would have the required properties.

Therefor in this study we developed an extension for OpenLISEM to simulate pesticide transport during erosive rainfall-runoff events: OpenLISEM-pesticide (OLP). We selected the physically-based fully distributed hydrology and sediment dynamics model OpenLISEM (v6.91) to implement pesticide dynamics because it can simulate both runoff and sediment dynamics in high detail, both spatially and temporally, and was designed for catchments from 1 ha up to approximately 100 km2 (De Roo and Jetten, 1999). Moreover this model is well tested and can simulate runoff and erosion processes during rainfall-runoff events adequately (Baartman et al., 2012; Jong and Jetten, 2007; Lefrancq et al., 2017b; Wu et al., 2021). The objectives of the study were to (1) include particulate pesticide transport in the models from Havis et al. (1992) and Joyce et al. (2008), and to implement this in the OpenLISEM model; (2) show a proof of concept of the model's capacity using two erosive rainfall events, for two different pesticides on small catchment scale; and (3) further explore the behaviour of the newly developed module with a sensitivity test of the pesticide-related model parameters.

2. Methods and model formulation
2.1. Concepts and equations describing pesticide dynamics during runoff
The movement of pesticides by runoff consists of two main processes, the uptake of the pesticide from the soil into the runoff water and the lateral transport with runoff over the soil surface. When pesticides are applied on a field a thin layer with high concentrations forms on the soil surface (Gassmann et al., 2015; Leonard, 1990). The uptake of the pesticides from the soil into runoff is often conceptualized with a ‘mixing layer’ (Ahuja and Lehman, 1983; Gao et al., 2004; Havis et al., 1992; Tong and Ye, 2020).

Different versions of the mixing layer model have been formulated, including complete mixing between the soil and the runoff (Ahuja et al., 1982) and non-uniform mixing decreasing with soil depth (Ahuja and Lehman, 1983; Young and Fry, 2019). These models assume complete mixing between runoff and the mixing zone, which is valid for timesteps of several hours or longer. When simulating soil-runoff interactions for runoff dynamics with timesteps of minutes or seconds, a mass transfer model can be used. The mass transfer coefficient describes the rate on which dissolved pesticides are taken up from the mixing layer into the runoff (Havis et al., 1992; Joyce et al., 2008). The exact physical and chemical processes in the mixing layer are highly complex and the mixing layer is simplified as a finite, steady and completely mixed reactor (Havis et al., 1992; Shao et al., 2021). The thickness of the mixing layer is defined as the depth of interaction between the soil and turbulent overland flow (Havis et al., 1992).

Sorption-desorption processes in the soil generally take several minutes to hours to reach equilibrium (Felsot and Dahm, 1979; Pignatello, 2015). At the start of a rainfall event sorption equilibrium can be assumed. With the soil-water partition coefficient (Kd) a linear, instantaneous, equilibrium concentration between dissolved and sorbed pesticides in the soil matrix can be described. This is valid if the sorption process is fast compared to the uptake of pesticides from the mixing layer (Havis et al., 1992). Because simulations for rainfall-runoff events are generally not longer than several hours, degradation of pesticides can be neglected.

In addition to dissolved uptake by the runoff, sorbed pesticides can be entrained with eroding sediments. This can be either through splash detachment by raindrops (De Roo et al., 1996), or flow detachment based on the transport capacity of the runoff water (Govers, 1990). When deposition occurs, sorbed pesticides are added to the mixing layer together with the sediment. The concentration of sorbed pesticides in runoff sediment can be higher than the concentration in the original soil. This enrichment occurs due to preferred transport of smaller soil particles and organic matter, which also tend to have a higher sorptivity for pesticides (Ghadiri and Rose, 1991, 1993). In a study comparing the enrichment rates for different soils and rainfall events, a decreasing exponential relation with the erosion rate was found (Menzel, 1980). When comparing organic matter contents between the fields and suspended sediment at the outlet in our observation dataset (Commelin et al., 2022b), the OM increases substantially indicating enrichment processes. For more details on observed enrichment see Annex B.1.

When the pesticides are taken up by the runoff, either dissolved in water (dissolved phase, DP) or sorbed to entrained soil particles (particulate phase, PP), lateral flow will transport the pesticides further downstream. The OpenLISEM model routes water over the soil surface with a kinematic wave based on the local drain direction (Chow et al., 1988). In OpenLISEM diffusion is assumed to be neglectable for the lateral transport of suspended sediment, because overland transport is an advection-dominated process. We also apply this assumption to the lateral transport of particulate and dissolved pesticides.

Combining the soil-runoff interactions and lateral transport of pesticides, at each raster cell in time and space, four concentrations in respective control volumes are relevant for the transport of pesticides:
1.
The dissolved concentration in the runoff (Crw, mg m−3)

2.
The dissolved concentration in the soil water in the mixing layer (Cmw, mg m−3)

3.
The sorbed concentration in the soil matrix in the mixing layer (Cms, mg kg−1)

4.
The sorbed concentration in the suspended sediment in the runoff (Crs, mg kg−1)


These concentrations are influenced by transfer between the runoff and the mixing layer and lateral transport. The water related pesticide fluxes are (1) infiltration through the mixing layer to deeper soil layers, (2) dissolved phase overland runoff and (3) uptake of pesticides by diffusion, convection and turbulent mixing from the mixing layer into the runoff (Joyce et al., 2008). For sediments, the pesticide fluxes include (4) enriched uptake through splash or flow detachment into the runoff, (5) deposition onto the soil surface with deposited sediment and (6) suspended sediment flow which transports the pesticides sorbed to sediment particles downstream. Finally (7) within the soil matrix equilibrium sorption redistributes pesticides between the dissolved and particulate phase. Contrary to the conceptualization of Havis et al. (1992) we do not include dissolved pesticide concentrations in the precipitation but assume that this is negligible.

This conceptual model can be described with equations for the governing processes. The flux of pesticides in runoff is described as:
Eq (1)
where Δx is the cell size (m), 
 the dissolved concentration of pesticides in the runoff (
, 
 the discharge of runoff 
, 
 the cross-sectional area of the flow 
, 
 is distance in the direction of runoff 
, 
 is time 
, 
 the transfer rate of the mixing layer 
, 
 the dissolved concentration of pesticides in the mixing layer (
,

.

The flux of dissolved pesticides in the mixing layer is calculated as:

where 
 is the soil porosity 
, 
 the depth of the mixing layer 
 and 
 is a sorption source or sink (mg kg−1 sec−1) either based on equilibrium sorption (Havis et al., 1992) or kinetic sorption (Joyce et al., 2008). The equilibrium sorption source or sink is calculated as:

 and 
 the enrichment ratio of the sorbed pesticide in the runoff compared to the mixing layer, calculated with:

 is a coefficient for which 7.4 is proposed as a general value by Menzel (1980), Sj the specific detachment rate of either splash or flow detachment (kg ha−1) and β the exponent, which was found to be −0.2 for many soil and management types (Menzel 1980). Finally, the sorbed flux in suspended sediment is calculated as:
Eq (6)

with 
 the suspended sediment concentration in the runoff 
.

2.2. Numerical solution and implementation in OpenLISEM
The numerical solution for overland flow with a 1D kinematic wave in OpenLISEM solves the Manning's equation with a semi-implicit Newton-Raphson method (Bout and Jetten, 2018; Chow et al., 1988; De Roo et al., 1996). The routing of substances in the runoff water, including pesticides, is calculated with an explicit solution of the momentum equation. To optimize mass conservation all pesticide fluxes are expressed as mass transfers from one control volume to the other. The different mass transfer processes are simulated separately in the following order (see Fig. 1): losses of pesticides by infiltration, equilibrium partitioning between sorbed and dissolved pesticides in the mixing layer, uptake of dissolved pesticides from the mixing layer to the runoff, uptake of sorbed pesticides by splash erosion, mass transfer of sorbed pesticides by flow detachment or deposition and finally the discharge of dissolved and particulate phase pesticides with runoff. This order of processes is in accordance with the calculation of both water and sediment fluxes by OpenLISEM. The extended OpenLISEM model with pesticide dynamics is named OpenLISEM-pesticide (OLP). Further details on the numerical implementation and the exact equations used in OLP can be found in annex A."
,,"2.3. The OpenLISEM model
To simulate pesticide dynamics during a rainfall event in detail, the hydrological processes need to be simulated first, because the pesticide transport is a secondary process. OpenLISEM is a physically-based hydrological model, which is a further development and open source version of the original Limburg Soil Erosion Model (LISEM) (De Roo et al., 1996; De Roo and Jetten, 1999). Overland flow is calculated with Manning's equation. Infiltration is simulated with a multi-layered implementation of the Green & Ampt equation (Downer et al., 2003; Green and Ampt, 1911). For erosion both splash detachment by raindrops and flow detachment are included. The transport capacity for suspended sediment by runoff is calculated with the equations presented by Govers (1990).

In the past decade upgrades have been added to the model, with most notable the addition of 2D dynamic wave solutions for overland flow and suspended sediment transport (Bout and Jetten, 2018). Originally, the model simulates overland flow by a 1D kinematic wave which uses a local drain direction (LDD) for flow routing. This latter option allows to define flow patterns not only based on topography, but also on tillage direction and landscape elements that are not captured in the DEM. This is of major importance for the correct simulation of overland flow patterns and identification of contributing areas within an agricultural catchment (Favis-Mortlock et al., 2022; Takken et al., 2001b). Therefore, in this study we used the 1D kinematic wave for flow routing.

2.4. The South-Limburg dataset
To test the performance of OLP we used two events (2019-05-28 and 2020-08-16) from an observational dataset collected in 2019 and 2020 (M. Commelin et al., 2022a). The study area is a small agricultural catchment (39 ha) in the hilly area of South-Limburg, the Netherlands (Fig. 2). Arable agriculture with a crop rotation of potatoes and winter cereals was the main land use (27 ha). Other land uses were an apple orchard (5 ha) and extensively managed grasslands (5 ha). The remaining area consisted of roads, buildings and some forest. All agriculture was under conventional crop management including pesticide applications. The catchment has an elevation difference of 30 m (80–110 m.a.s.l.) and average slopes of 6 % (range 0.1–30 %). The soil type is a Luvisol with a silt loam texture. The catchment has a temperate climate (Cfb) with a mean annual precipitation of 757 mm and a mean annual temperature of 10.7 °C. A dry ditch connects the fields to the catchment outlet, and runoff only occurs for short periods after rainfall events. In the catchment, soil surface samples (0–10 mm depth) were taken in the agricultural fields (see Fig. 2). At the outlet of the catchment runoff and sediment samples were collected automatically every 6 min during runoff events. Pesticide analysis for glyphosate was done following the procedure described by Bento et al. (2016) and metobromuron was analysed with the QuEChERS method (Anastassiades et al., 2003; Mol et al., 2008). The available samples for both events are presented in Table 2. Further details on the used dataset, data collection and analysis of pesticides are described in Commelin et al., 2022b.

The two events were selected because field samples were taken during or close to the occurrence of the rainfall events, and thus OLP could be initialized directly. Other events in this dataset will need additional long-term simulations to provide the concentrations in the mixing layer at the start of the rainfall event. During the two selected events the only compound detected in both dissolved phase (DP) and particulate phase (PP) transport was metobromuron; in addition, we also selected glyphosate for model evaluation, which was detected in PP. Glyphosate is often applied just before the start of the growing season in arable no-tillage management, to reduce weed pressure. In addition, in the apple orchard glyphosate was used to prevent vegetation growth under the trees. Metobromuron is also a pre-emergence herbicide used to control weeds and grasses. Both compounds were applied on the potato fields before emergence of the crop, and glyphosate was applied, at the start of the growing season, below the trees on the apple orchard.

2.5. Model initialization
OpenLISEM-pesticide is an event-based model that needs to be initialized with the conditions for water, sediment and pesticide dynamics at the start of the simulated rainfall-runoff event. The required data can be obtained by field measurements, the use of available datasets (e.g., topography, aerial imagery or satellite data) as well as by the use of models designed for larger temporal scales. The uncertainty in occurrence time of rainstorm events will make it difficult to obtain accurate field measurements of pesticide concentrations before an event.

2.5.1. Input data and initialization of the pesticide module
At the start of a rainfall event, the dissolved and sorbed concentrations of the simulated substance in the mixing layer in combination with the partition coefficient 
 are input for OLP. The initial concentrations of pesticides in the soil can be obtained either by observations through soil samples or from another model. In our two year dataset, we obtained field observation samples for two events, which we use in this study. The partitioning of a pesticide is uncertain for specific pedo-climatic conditions (Kumari and John, 2020; Sadegh-Zadeh, 2017), however best estimates are available from literature, where possible adjusted for soil type. When soil partitioning was not provided, we estimated this from the organic carbon partitioning (Koc) with:
Eq (7)

With OM the organic matter fraction which we divide by 2.0 to convert to organic carbon. A conversion factor of 2.0 is shown to be generally more accurate that the conventional 1.724 conversion factor (Pribyl, 2010). For glyphosate the Kd is 48 mL g−1 for a silt loam (European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), 2015). In case of metobromuron a Koc of 197 mL g−1 is given (Lewis et al., 2016). Using equation (7) with an organic matter content of 3.6 % in the fields in our study area the Kd of metobromuron is 3.5 mL g−1. The depth 
 and the mass transfer rate 
 of the mixing layer are also needed. Reported mass transfer rates in previous studies are in the range of 0.001–0.1 mm s−1, combined with mixing layer depths of 0.1–25 mm (Havis et al., 1992; Joyce et al., 2010; Watanabe and Grismer, 2003). In this study we used a fixed mixing layer depth of 6 mm as a best estimate in accordance with the mean mixing layer depths found for arable field plots by Havis et al. (1992). The mass transfer rate was used for calibration, an initial value of 0.007 mm s−1 was used. A test over a large range of mass transfer rate values (1 10−6 to 100 mm s−1) showed that from 1 mm s−1 upwards, equilibrium between the mixing layer and the runoff is simulated (see for more details Annex B.5).

2.5.2. Initialization of OpenLISEM
The OpenLISEM model requires input data on topography, land use and related crop cover, and soil characteristics for infiltration and erosion. All this data was obtained from available public data sets (AHN4 0.5 m DTM, Top10NL topography, open satellite images) and field measurements and observations (crop cover and crop height, infiltration speed, and images of spatial distribution of runoff and erosion patterns after rainfall events). To obtain realistic initialization for each event, and to differentiate between events throughout a growing season, the temporal constraint strategy (TCS) as proposed by Lefrancq et al. (2017a) was applied. This relates infiltration and erosion parameters to temporal variation throughout the season. The crop and soil characteristics were specified either homogeneously for the whole catchment, or specifically for each crop type within the catchment (homogeneous per field), the only exception for this was the addition of wheel track patterns in potato cultivation. Other studies relate wheel tracks with increased runoff (Prasuhn, 2020) and higher herbicide transport (Baker and Laflen, 1979). We therefore selected wheel tracks in the potato field based on aerial images and modelled these with a width of 50 cm. The crop cover, hydraulic conductivity, porosity, Manning's n, random roughness and soil cohesion in the wheel tracks differ compared to the potato field due to the higher compaction of the soil caused by machines driving on the tracks regularly. On other fields no wheel track patterns were observed.

When simulating runoff and erosion during rainfall-runoff events, the correct representation of topography and stream patterns within a catchment is fundamental for meaningful model simulations (Favis-Mortlock et al., 2022). One important aspect in this case was the influence of tillage operations on streamflow (Couturier et al., 2013; Souchère et al., 1998; Takken et al., 2001b). Since our observational dataset includes fields with potato cultivation, a model was required that could incorporate tillage direction into flow patterns in the field, since these are not captured by the digital elevation model. The cultivation of potatoes was done on ridges of about 25 cm high. We applied the Tillage Controlled Runoff Pattern (TCRP) model (Takken et al., 2001a) to recalculate flow patterns for each growing season within the catchment. The spatial resolution used in the model simulations was 2 m (2 m) and the timestep five (5) seconds. Details on all specific parameters, and the method of estimation is given in Annex B, Table B1.

After initial initialization, adjustments were made to improve simulation within the catchment. Small discretization errors or mismatches between different map layers can have large impacts on simulation results at the outlet. Two examples of improvements are (1) the adjustment of the tarmac road cells, to coincide with the predicted streamline of the local drain direction (LDD). Observations showed clearly that water flowed over the road and not 1 m besides it through the grassland. This changed the simulated timing of the peak at the outlet due to faster flow over roads. In addition (2), LDD flow perpendicular to the tillage direction through a thalweg or valley bottom should include the water buffering effect of the tilled ridges. OpenLISEM uses the random roughness to calculate the depression storage before overland flow occurs, for a cell in the thalweg the RR was increased with half the height of the tillage structures. On potato fields this resulted in buffering of runoff which would otherwise have been simulated, but which was not observed during the events and field inspections.

2.6. Model calibration and evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the model we did a qualitative assessment of the simulated spatial patterns of runoff and erosion based on observations in the catchment during the event and we calculated goodness-of-fit parameters for runoff, suspended sediment and transported pesticides at the outlet. We visited the study area during or shortly after the rainfall events to collect samples from the fields and the outlet. During these visits we observed the flow patterns on the different fields. The quantitative evaluation of the hydro- and sedigraph at the outlet was done by calculating the root mean square error (RMSE), the Nash-Sutcliff (NSE) (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970) and Kling-Gupta (KGE) (Gupta et al., 2009) efficiency coefficients. Many studies have shown that using a single goodness-of-fit (GOF) parameter can lead to incorrect evaluation of model adequacy (Clark et al., 2021; Knoben et al., 2019; Seibert et al., 2018). As benchmark we compared the RMSE with the uncertainty of the observations from Commelin et al., 2022b.

2.7. Sensitivity analysis
To explore the sensitivity of the model predictions to variations in input a one at a time (OAT) sensitivity analysis was done. By varying a specific parameter around a calibrated baseline more understanding of the model dynamics and interactions can be obtained (Joyce et al., 2008; Lefrancq et al., 2017b). The influence was evaluated based on the change in the total simulated transport for DP and PP. Besides pesticide related parameters, we also included runoff en erosion related parameters that are identified as sensitive in earlier studies for OpenLISEM (Lefrancq et al., 2017b; Wu et al., 2021). These consist of the saturated hydraulic conductivity, the capillary pressure at the wetting front, Mannings’ n, soil cohesion and precipitation. Varying these parameters will show the relationship between model performance for runoff and erosion and pesticide simulations. All parameter values were varied these ±20 % around the calibrated value. The sensitivity analysis was applied on the event of 2019-05-28 for metobromuron, since in this case transport in both DP and PP was observed.

2.8. Software used for data analysis and model development
The OpenLISEM-pesticide model was written in C++ and compiled using QT and CMake. It is available under both windows and Linux operating systems. The field scale simulations in this study have a runtime of 4–8 min on a current CPU (Intel i7 3632QM), depending on the selected model options. The main data analysis and workflow was done with R (R Core Team, 2023). All codes to perform the analysis and model runs for this study, including a windows executable of OpenLISEM-pesticide v.1 can be found on the code repository: https://doi.org/10.4121/1838022f-05ee-4243-b599-097a777cde1c and https://github.com/mcommelin/openlisem_pesticide_model_development. Input maps for OpenLISEM were produced in PCRaster 4.4.0 (Karssenberg et al., 2010) which we integrated with R. Spatial analysis and manipulation of maps was done using QGIS 3.28 (QGIS.org, 2023). For this study we used OpenLISEM version 6.91 with pesticide extension version 1.0. The code is available at github.com (https://github.com/vjetten/openlisem/tree/lisem_pest).

3. Results
3.1. Simulations of runoff and erosion
The model performance after manual calibration is shown in Table 3. At initialization the predicted amount of runoff was far below the observations, and too much infiltration was simulated. The main adjustments in both events were done for the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) and the wetted front capillary pressure (ψ), these two parameters are of main importance in the Green & Ampt infiltration model (Downer et al., 2003). Further small adjustments were done for Manning's n and the initial soil moisture to improve runoff and erosion predictions, for initial and calibrated settings see Table B3 in Annex B. After calibration, the second event (2020-08-16) had a lower performance for simulated runoff compared to the first event (2019-05-28). The falling limb of the hydrograph was too steep and simulated runoff decreased much faster than observed.

Fig. 3 shows the observed and simulated discharge and suspended sediment loads for both events. The runoff and erosion for the first event are simulated adequately. The two consecutive rainfall peaks also result in two runoff peaks, where the second was substantially higher due to decreased infiltration rates. For the second event, less detailed rainfall data was available. OpenLISEM simulates a first main peak, which originates from the potato cultivation (field A in Fig. 2), because of the high rainfall intensity also runoff occurs on other fields in the catchment. These fields have a higher soil cover, grass or cereal stubbles, which increases the flow resistance, leading to a later arrival of the water at the outlet. This is visible in both the simulated and the observed hydrograph."
,,"3.3. Sensitivity analysis results
Table 6 shows the results of the ‘one-at-a-time’(OAT) sensitivity analysis in which we explored the behaviour of the pesticide module on transport of DP and PP pesticides. The mass transfer rate and the soil water partitioning both have a strong effect on the total load of dissolved pesticides, a 20 % change in these parameters also results in about 20 % change in transported mass. The mixing layer depth has less influence with a three to four percent change in discharge. Particulate phase transport is mainly influenced by the parameters in the equation for the enrichment ratio. A 20 % change in the exponent results in more than 20 % change in particulate phase discharge. The soil-water partitioning and mixing layer depth also influence the PP transport but only to a small extent. In several cases a change in one of the input parameters increased the KGE for PP transport, for example a higher exponent (β) for the enrichment ratio.

Note: The mass balance error for water, sediment and pesticides in all above model runs is < 1 10−10 %. The total simulated loads of DP and PP in the base run were 7792 and 14740 mg respectively.


Besides the specific parameters included in the new pesticide module, we also varied several parameters related to runoff and erosion processes. For this we observe that infiltration and precipitation had a major influence and variations of ±20 % resulted in very large changes in pesticide transport. For example, 20 % more precipitation produced 190 % PP transport and, vice versa, 20 % less rainfall resulted in only 23 % of transport in PP. We also varied the soil cohesion as the main parameter influencing erosion. As expected, this did not influence the transport of dissolved pesticides and only had a minor influence on PP transport. In general, the changes of runoff related parameters in the setup of OpenLISEM had a larger impact on the PP transport than on DP transport. In both cases the variations due to uncertainty in these parameters were larger than for the specific pesticide parameters.

4. Discussion
During rainfall-runoff events large amounts of pesticides can be transported either dissolved in water or sorbed to suspended sediment (Commelin et al., 2022b; Halbach et al., 2021). Potentially, physically-based models which are spatially fully distributed can increase our understanding of the transport process, the source areas and redistribution of pesticides in fields or in catchments (Payraudeau and Gregoire, 2012). With OLP we extended the OpenLISEM model to simulate the event-based dynamics of pesticides, which creates future options to further explore transport during rainfall-runoff events and test different best management practises (BMP's) for possible mitigation. OLP is a more complex model than many conventionally used pesticide models. These other models often aim for longer term load predictions, however event-specific simulations need a different approach to simulate the relevant processes on this time scale. The advantages and drawbacks of OLP are discussed in the following section, followed by a discussion of the accuracy of the runoff and erosion simulations underlining OLP. Finally we discuss of the main sensitive parameters and further perspectives for OLP use is given.

4.1. Advantages and drawbacks of OLP
4.1.1. Conceptualization in OLP
OLP is an implementation of the conceptual model initially developed by Havis et al. (1992). This model was further developed and tested to include crop wash off and kinetic sorption (Joyce et al., 2008; Watanabe and Grismer, 2003), these studies showed that the model could reliably simulate dissolved pesticide transport with overland flow on plot scale. In OLP we added particulate phase transport, including enrichment of sorbed pesticides when transported with detached sediment, and applied this model on small catchment scale (38 ha). The enrichment was based on experimental relations reported by Menzel (1980), which is also included in the GLEAMS model (DeMars et al., 2018; Leonard et al., 1987). Conceptually the OLP module is suitable for transport simulations of all types of pesticides, including herbicides, fungicides and insecticides. If pesticides, like fungicides or insecticides, are applied on the crop shortly before a rainfall-runoff event, crop wash-off might contribute substantially to pesticide transport (Joyce et al., 2008; Morselli et al., 2018). Crop cover wash off was not included in OLP since the two events in this study had a low crop cover (<20 %) on the pesticide source fields. Other more complex process descriptions were currently not included in OLP. For example, the estimation of mixing layer depth dependent on rainfall intensity (Havis et al., 1992) or relating the mass transfer rate to flow speed and turbulence (Wallach et al., 1988).

4.1.2. OLP calibration and performance
To calibrate the pesticide simulations in OLP we used two parameters: the mass transfer rate (Kfilm) for the dissolved transport, and the exponent in the enrichment ratio (β) for particulate transport. The β we had to adjust to a different value for each event and pesticide to improve the simulations. Specific calibration for each event is a well-known issue for event-based models (Baartman et al., 2012; Vieira et al., 2022), and further simulations on a larger dataset including multi-event calibration and temporal constraining are needed to further understand the temporal variations of the simulated processes (Lefrancq et al., 2017b). However, even with an event specific simulation, the simulation provides insight in the dynamics in the catchment and a calibrated simulation can be used to test the effect of BMPs (Kabeja et al., 2021).

After calibration the main transport peaks and source areas of pesticides within the catchment were well simulated for the events and compounds in this study. However, hydrologic connection of different source areas with high concentrations at the start or end of the runoff event were not well captured. For example, the contribution of glyphosate transport from the apple orchard was not clarified by OLP simulations. The observations suggest transport from this field but in the OpenLISEM simulation no runoff and thus no pesticide transport was simulated. Another unexplained process entails the metobromuron transport during the event on 2019-05-28. Were in the other simulations the field concentrations was lower than the PP concentration at the outlet, in this simulation the concentration observed in the field was higher than in the runoff. Based on the concept of enrichment an increase would be expected (Ghadiri and Rose, 1993). In the calibration the β was increased to the lowest value reported by Menzel (1980) to improve the simulation.

4.1.3. OLP compared with other pesticide models
When comparing OLP to other available overland transport pesticide models, each model has its specific focus resulting in strengths and limitations (see also Table 1). The temporal scales on which the models are applied varies from multiple years to several days (e.g. SWAT, PRZM, RZWQM, ZinAgriTRA and DYNAPLUS) (Cambien et al., 2020; DeMars et al., 2018; Gassmann et al., 2015; Morselli et al., 2018; Young and Fry, 2014), to event-specific simulations (e.g. PESHMELBA and VFSMOD) (Reichenberger et al., 2023; Rouzies et al., 2019). The spatial representation of the catchment differs between hydrological units (SWAT, PESHMELBA, VFSMOD, PRZM and RZWQM) or fully distributed (ZinAgritra). However, none of these models simulate pesticide transport with the conceptual model by Havis et al. (1992), which aims to describe the transport process on small time scales relevant for the dynamics in headwater catchments during runoff events.

The GSSHA model has promising properties to also simulate pesticide transport dynamic during erosive rainfall-runoff events, as identified in Table 1. We did not find an application of GSSHA for pesticide transport, but a study simulating nitrate discharge shows the potential of GSSHA (Pradhan et al., 2014). There are several differences in the process descriptions for infiltration, erosion processes and pesticide uptake and transport between OLP and GSSHA. For example the erosion is calculated with different a equation (OLP – Govers, 1990; GSSHA – Kilinc and Richardson, 1973) and GSSHA takes particles size distribution of the suspended sediment into account. A future comparison of both models might give more understanding of the implications of these differences.

Previous modelling studies investigating particulate phase transport of pesticides, identify low performance, and lack of spatial distribution of erosion predictions as limiting factors (Chen et al., 2017; DeMars et al., 2018). The mechanistic soil erosion simulations by OpenLISEM include specific source areas and redistribution within the catchment. In this study the performance of sediment load predictions was good (KGE >0.85), which forms a basis for adequate PP pesticide transport simulations. By combining mechanistic erosion simulations and enrichment of sorbed pesticides compared to the concentration in the soil, the PP transport could be simulated. Other modelling studies on pesticide transport have identified this as a relevant addition (Cambien et al., 2020; Morselli et al., 2018; Rouzies et al., 2019). The fully distributed characteristics of OLP make it suitable to simulate effects of best management practises on field and catchment scale, a need that is identified in previous review articles (Centanni et al., 2023; Payraudeau and Gregoire, 2012).

4.1.4. OLP applicability
Modelling runoff, sediment, and pesticide dynamic processes with OLP is complex and reliable results need observation data for initialization and calibration as was also observed for other models (Gassmann et al., 2015; Morselli et al., 2018; Purnell et al., 2020; Rouzies et al., 2019). Several models on pesticide transport (e.g. VFSMOD and SWAT) have as one of the design goals, to be applicable by non-modellers (Carluer et al., 2017; Purnell et al., 2020). With OLP, this is less the case, and the demands for input data, system knowledge and model setup are high. Therefore, the current version of OLP has limited use for policy makers and stakeholders but is suitable for improved understanding and application on specific case studies. In this first study we used field observations to initialize OLP, however these might often not be available. Many models exist that are suitable to simulate pesticide fate over a growing season, for example FOCUSPEARL, PRZM or SWAT. OpenLISEM-pesticide can be coupled with one of these, and soil concentrations at the start of the rainfall event can be obtained from this model.

4.2. Accuracy of runoff and erosion simulations
Since the quality and accuracy of simulated pesticide transport depends on the correct prediction of water and sediment dynamics in a catchment (Reichenberger et al., 2023), adequate performance of OpenLISEM in terms of runoff and erosion predictions is a prerequisite for further pesticide simulations with OLP. However, when simulating dynamic spatio-temporal processes with complex models, two major risks are equifinality and modelling ‘right-results-for-wrong-reasons’ (Beven and Lane, 2022; Kelleher et al., 2017). Additional qualitative evaluation of the results can reduce these risks (Batista et al., 2019; Knoben et al., 2019; Schürz and Schulz, 2022). We limited these risks by combining detailed understanding of the catchment, adjustments for tillage directions (Takken et al., 2001a) and landscape elements influencing flow patterns (Favis-Mortlock et al., 2022; Sidle et al., 2017), with temporal variations throughout the growing season for the most influential parameters (Lefrancq et al., 2017b). The predictions of OpenLISEM were adequate for both runoff and erosion. This was not only tested in terms of discharge at the outlet, but also verified with spatial observations within the catchment (Annex B.4, Figure B1 and B.2).

Several specific processes, which might influence the quantity, as well as the source area of runoff and sediment remain hard to capture in the initialization of the model. Two examples are the connection or disconnection of potato ridges to the wheel tracks, which trapped water and sediment before flowing onto the wheel tracks, or the sub-resolution effects of tree lines in the apple orchard. Other processes that could not be simulated well within the current possibilities of the OpenLISEM model include for example, divergence of flow directions based on the amount of discharge. In our simulations all water flows through the main channel, while observations show that also some water flowed over the road along the channel. This could have been simulated by using 2D dynamic-wave flow routing, but this has as disadvantage that sub-resolution patterns like potato ridges cannot be included in the flow pattern. We decided that potato ridges were in this case more important for correct simulations.

4.3. Sensitive parameters and perspectives
The results of the sensitivity analysis in this study correspond to a large extent to the results presented by Joyce et al. (2008). The mass transfer rate influences the uptake of dissolved pesticides, although uptake also depends on the availability of water on the soil surface. The spatial distribution of pesticide uptake as shown in Fig. 5C shows that extended ponding will increase the amount of pesticides entering runoff water. The main processes influencing the transport of dissolved pesticides from agricultural fields are the uptake from the mixing layer and the infiltration rate. If high infiltration rates occur, either in the field, or in a vegetated buffer zone, the dissolved pesticides in runoff can re-enter the soil matrix. For PP pesticide transport the enrichment ratio parameters showed the most influence on simulated transport. Moreover, there is a very strong relation between soil detachment and pesticide transport: if the erosion rates in the field are reduced the transported load of PP pesticide will also decrease.

In this study we did not include a thorough evaluation of the model. However, multi-event and multiple compound calibration, evaluation and sensitivity analyses, including parameter correlations, might improve the robustness of the model, and our understanding of the scope and quantification of the pesticide-related parameters under field conditions. We plan to include this in a follow-up study, using a multi-event dataset from the study by Commelin et al., 2022b.

5. Conclusions
In this study we present a novel model extension, OpenLISEM-pesticide (OLP), that is designed to simulate overland transport of pesticides in both dissolved and particulate phase, during rainfall-runoff events. In conclusion:
-
We combined particulate pesticide transport, including enrichment, with the pesticide transport model by Havis et al. (1992) and integrated this with OpenLISEM.

-
The simulations for two compounds and two events, which are in line with field observations, are a proof-of-concept that OLP can give more insight in transport dynamics, source areas and redistribution of pesticides during erosive rainfall-runoff events.

-
The sensitivity analysis showed that for dissolved phase transport the mass transfer rate of the mixing layer was of main importance. Particulate phase transport is most sensitive to the parameters in the enrichment ratio equation. Besides that, the performance and accuracy of the pesticide transport predictions, depend strongly on the accuracy of runoff and erosion simulations.


This extension of OpenLISEM can be applied to further investigate and understand the contribution of rapid runoff and related erosion to the transport of pesticides into the environment. OLP has the potential to help mitigate environmental pollution by simulating redistribution within the field or catchment, as well as identifying main source areas, which can be used to target BMPs. Further research is needed to test the robustness of the model for different pesticides, agronomical systems and pedo-climatic zones.

Besides loads and concentrations at the outlet, OLP also produces maps with the redistribution of the pesticides in the catchment during the event. The redistribution can show source and accumulation areas of pesticides and can for example be used to simulate the effects of best management practises (BMP's) for specific fields. Fig. 5 shows the final concentration and mass change for glyphosate during the event of 2019-05-28. Glyphosate was detected in three fields (B, C and D, Fig. 2), where the concentration in the apple orchard is about 10 times higher than in the two arable fields (Fig. 5, A). The mass of PP transport follows the patterns of erosion: where slopes in the fields increase glyphosate is entrained in the runoff and where the flow velocity decreases due to reduction in slope or due to change in land use from arable land to grass land, deposition occurs and the glyphosate is deposited (Fig. 5, B). This pattern is also reflected in the final concentration in field B. Dissolved uptake and transport of glyphosate depends on the availability of runoff water, and where infiltration is dominant the dissolved glyphosate can return to the soil matrix (Fig. 5, C). In the valley section in field B a lot of ponding is simulated between the potato ridges, this results in increased uptake of glyphosate into the runoff water. The channel bottom and grassed field where runoff occurs, function as infiltration site. Here up to 0.05 mg m−2 is added to the soil matrix"
,,"Abstract
Pesticides are chemical substances of natural or synthetic origin that are used to eradicate pests and insects. These are indispensable in the agricultural processes for better crop production. Pesticide use aims to promote crop yield and protect the crops from diseases and damage. Pesticides must be handled carefully and disposed of appropriately because they are dangerous to people and other species by default. Environmental pollution occurs when pesticide contamination spreads away from the intended plants. Older pesticides such as lindane and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) may remain in water and soil for a longer time. These accumulate in various parts of the food chain and cause damage to the ecosystem. Biological techniques in the management of pest control such as importation, augmentation, and conservation, and the accompanying procedures are more efficient, less expensive, and ecologically sound than other ways. This review mainly focuses on the consequences on the targeted and non-targeted organisms including the health and well-being of humans by the use of pesticides and their toxicity. The side effects that occur when a pesticide's LD50 exceeds the accepted limit through oral or skin penetration due to their binding to various receptors such as estrogen receptors, GABA, EGFR, and others. These pesticide classes include carbamates, pyrethroids, organochlorides, organophosphorus, and others. The current study seeks to highlight the urgent requirement for a novel agricultural concept that includes a major reduction in the use of chemical pesticides."
,,"1. Introduction
Any plants, animals, or microorganisms that affect food, health, or comfort are considered pests. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines pesticides as a class of chemical compounds used to manage and deter the population of pests. It was also used to control other living things like nematodes, and arthropods like insects and vertebrates, which ruin our food sources leading to a variety of health issues. Pesticides can be summed up as chemicals that are applied to a wide range of crops to protect them against insects, weeds, and pests to nourish and improve crop yield (García et al., 2022; Rani et al., 2021). Around the 1500s, the use of mercury and arsenic was in the early stages. They were utilized until the year 1940 for destroying food supplies during World War II (Abubakar et al., 2020). Various efforts were made in the 19th century for the development of pesticides wherein potatoes were treated with Paris Green in the USA to control Colorado beetles, and many equipment were also developed like the Horse drew sprayer, Wheeled sprayer, and Barrel spray. In the 20th century, the efforts were focused on two main areas, the use of extracts from plants and certain inorganic chemicals as pesticides (Davis, 2019). Paul Muller's discovery of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) as a pesticide is a significant moment in the history of pesticides. The damage caused by DDT was much less than other pesticides in agriculture and human health wise. In 1962, the book “Silent Spring” explained the harmful effects of DDT which resulted in a decline in the usage of DDT and many states banned DDT (Abubakar et al., 2020). Despite their advantages, pesticides are still destructive to the environment and people. Numerous compounds are poisonous, bio-accumulative, and ecologically stable. Some pesticides can linger in the environment for years because they are long-lasting (Pathak et al., 2022).

Pesticide residues can be discovered in a wide range of common foods and drinks, such as prepared fruit juices, wine, water, snacks, poultry food, and other meals. It must be understood that only washing and peeling off do not eliminate the pesticide residues. Human breast milk tests have also shown pesticide residues, raising worries about fetal exposure and the health impacts on offspring (Nicolopoulou-Stamati et al., 2016). Pesticides can be categorized in several ways, including the pests which are used to control. For instance, insecticides prevent the growth or survival of insects, herbicides control weeds and grasses, rodenticides kill rodents such as rats, avicides control the population of birds, and fungicides kill fungi (Pawar et al., 2013). Based on their chemical makeup and the type of their active chemicals, pesticides are categorized most frequently and most effectively. Such classification provides information about the effectiveness, physical characteristics, and chemical composition of the various pesticides. When deciding on the manner of application, the precautions to be taken during the application, and the application rates, knowledge of the chemical and physical properties of pesticides is highly helpful. Pesticides are classified into two main categories synthetic and natural. Synthetic pesticides are further classified into organic (structure-based) and inorganic. Organochlorines, organophosphates, carbamates, and pyrethroids are examples of organic synthetic pesticides. The natural pesticides are pyrethrin, neem, spinosad, and rotenone (Yadav and Devi, 2017). The chemical structure of pesticides can also be used to classify them as organochlorines (DDT and aldrin), organophosphates (chlorpyrifos and diazinon), benzoic acids (dicamba), carbamates (aldicarb and carbaryl), phenoxy acetic acid derivatives (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) (Boro et al., 2011), pyrethroids and pyrethrins (cyfluthrin and cypermethrin), triazines (atrazine and simazine), and dipyridyl derivatives (maneb and ziram) (Bernardes et al., 2015). The most widely used pesticide among organophosphates, which were touted as an eco-friendly alternative to organochlorines, is glyphosate. Other pesticides that are well-known in this class include dimethoate, parathion, malathion, and others with a history of endocrine disruption. This class of pesticides has been linked to health issues related to endocrine and nervous systems, cellular oxidative stress, effects on the functioning of important enzymes such as cholinesterase, reduced secretion of insulin, dysregulation of cellular metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, and increased genotoxic effects. Population-based research has suggested links between exposure to organophosphates and major health issues, such as dementia, cardiovascular illnesses, adverse effects on the reproductive system in males including the nervous system, and an elevated risk for non-lymphoma Hodgkin. Additionally, prenatal exposure to organophosphorus pesticides is related to shorter gestational times and children developing neurological issues (Nicolopoulou-Stamati et al., 2016).

A total of 200 papers were taken into consideration for this work from electronic databases such as Bentham, Science Direct, Springer, and PubMed. 154 research and review publications over the last fifteen years have been chosen, and keywords like “pesticides,” “toxicity,” and “contamination” have been included (Fig. 1). In addition to this, data from clinical studies, and marketed products were also searched to write this review."
,,"2. Effect of pesticides on the environment
An ecosystem is a region in which the interactions of flora, fauna, and other living things with the environment, climate, and other factors create a bubble of life. Both biotic, or living, components and abiotic, or nonliving, components make up an ecosystem. The impact of pesticides on various target and non-target organisms and, the detrimental effects of pesticides on soil, water, and air are described below.

2.1. Abiotic
2.1.1. Surface water contamination
Despite being sprayed on the soil; pesticides can travel great distances due to precipitation and evaporation. Furthermore, pesticides infiltrate the soil, seep into the groundwater, and enter water bodies through surface runoff. Thus, a diverse range of chemicals have been found in surface waters across the globe at high concentrations and can have negative impacts on organisms that are not intended targets. Some of the impacts caused by these substances are chromosomal alterations, oxidative stress, immune system and neurological system issues, and endocrine abnormalities. These effects may be particularly severe in children and pregnant women. Furthermore, pesticides are often found in complex combinations in surface waters that are challenging to assess and may have synergistic and additive effects (De Souza et al., 2020).

2.1.2. Soil fertility
Since pesticides are a necessary component of contemporary agriculture (Chen et al., 2014) the entire ecosystem has been impacted by the enormous chemical pressure they have placed on agricultural soil (Karpouzas et al., 2014; Kienzler et al., 2017; Kumar et al., 2015b; Rivera-Becerril et al., 2017). Soil uses certain biosynthetic chelates to transport the metal nutrients to the plant system. In addition, pesticides used on the same soil surface may compete with one another to chelate the metal ions (Kumar et al., 2015a).

2.1.3. Groundwater contamination
The resources of groundwater and surface water are constantly at risk of pollution because of pesticide movement in the soil, water solubility, weather, climate, distance traveled, applied quantity, etc. (Yadav et al., 2015). As safe drinking water is essential for food preparation, agriculture, and cleaning, it is also necessary for the survival of life on Earth. According to research, (Belmans et al., 2018) water resources contain high concentrations of pesticides, phosphorus, and nitrates. Excess fertilizers enter stagnant water bodies by seepage, irrigation, rain, soil erosion, or other means and affect the physicochemical characteristics of the water. Contaminated water leaches and has an impact on groundwater as well (Namdev et al., 2011).

2.2. Biotic
2.2.1. The effect of pesticides on insect microbiome
Insects inhabit an environment rich in toxic substances, including plant toxins and synthetic pesticides. For evolution, insects have adapted to cope with these challenges through mechanisms such as toxin neutralization, alterations in target sites, and detoxification processes. While it was initially thought that these resistance mechanisms were solely encoded in the insect genomes, recent analyses utilizing omics technologies have revealed the presence of specific intestinal microorganisms in certain organisms. Some of these microorganisms play a role in enhancing an insect's resistance to phytotoxins and pesticides (Itoh et al., 2018).

2.2.2. The effect of pesticides on the microbiome of aquatic organisms
A common insecticide in horticulture and agriculture is trichlorfon (Woo and Chung, 2020). In aquaculture, this substance is actively utilized to treat a variety of parasite illnesses. Because it is highly soluble in water, overuse of pesticides containing phosphorus causes pollution in the environment (Li et al., 2017).

2.2.3. The effect of pesticides on the microbiome of model organisms
Numerous studies have investigated the adverse effects of various pesticides on specific living organisms, consistently revealing negative xenobiotic impacts. The primary subjects for toxicological research on pesticide effects are often mice and rats. Chlorpyrifos, a broad-spectrum insecticide, disrupts signaling pathways associated with the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (Qiao et al., 2021). Additionally, chlorpyrifos is frequently detected in food, exerting an influence on the normal functioning of both the endocrine and gastrointestinal systems. These effects were demonstrated through oral administration to rats fed a specialized diet with varying fat contents (Otênio et al., 2022).

2.2.4. Effect of pesticides on animals
Wild animals can experience direct pesticide poisoning when exposed to a harmful dose of commercial products. Additionally, there are indirect consequences of pesticide use, such as a decline in partridge chick survival following herbicide spraying. This is attributed to the elimination of weeds, which are a food source for insects that the chicks depend on. Without insects, the partridge chicks face starvation (Mateo et al., 2022). Various scenarios of direct exposure are documented, including accidental poisoning from authorized (licensed) use and illegal poisoning. As extensively discussed by Moreau et al., through model experiments and field studies that revealed frequent avian mortality after the intentional use of pesticides in agricultural fields (Moreau et al., 2022).

The creation of pesticides that can kill a variety of pests has increased during the past few decades. Due to the increased quantity and frequency of pesticide applications, the targeted pests evolved and adapted to the newer environments and harsh conditions which led to an increase in the prevalence of the resurgence of pests and the appearance of pesticide-resistant species (Gill and Garg, 2014). Pesticide poisoning is a serious risk for many employees and citizens, particularly in rural areas where pesticide exposure is frequent. The toxicity of a pesticide is its capacity or ability to cause injury or illness. The toxicity of a particular pesticide is determined by subjecting test animals to varying dosages of the active ingredient (a.i.) and each of its formulated products. The active ingredient is the chemical component in the pesticide product that controls the pest. The two types of toxicity are acute and chronic. The toxicity is measured by LD50 (lethal dose) or LC50 (lethal concentration) and is recorded in mg/kg of body weight of the test animal or by parts per million (ppm). The lower the LD50 values indicate the greater its toxicity to humans and animals. Pesticides can enter the body in different ways such as oral (through the mouth and digestive system), dermal (skin), and inhalation (nose and respiratory system) (Perez Santin et al., 2021; Pérez-Santín et al., 2023). The Acute toxicity measures and warnings are given in Table 1."
,,"Moreover, workers and farmers, are frequently exposed to relatively higher levels of pesticides, occupational exposure to pesticides is giving rise to more hazards. For an instance, it has been noted that farmers exhibit greater immunotoxicity of pesticides during the pesticide spraying season. Particularly, B and T lymphocyte deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage was greater in farmers than non-farmers, demonstrating that pesticides may have the ability to cause immunotoxicity through their effects on human genotoxicity (Lee and Choi, 2020). Several pesticides are responsible for significant changes in the autonomic, central, and peripheral nervous systems functions (such as cholinergic crises) which are followed by neuropsychiatric sequelae (mood disorders, depression, and anxiety). These consequences of using pesticides as weapons in addition to being the primary causes of neuropsychiatric illnesses which could lead to suicide attempts (Bernardes et al., 2015). However, pesticides will continue to be an essential tool in our toolbox for protecting crops and preventing illness of the plants (Sargent et al., 2023; Singh et al., 2023). In addition to being outlawed and made illegal in many nations, organochlorine (OC) insecticides have been used successfully to combat diseases like malaria and typhus (Kumar et al., 2021). A malaria-control effort was started in India in the year 1953 and was quite successful. Total malarial cases decreased from 75 million yearly in 1947 to 100,000 in 1965, while the number of malaria-related deaths decreased from 800,000 annually to almost none (Donnelly, 2019). Fig. 2 depicts the effect of pesticides on human health and environmen"
,,"3. Chemical pesticides and their impact on human health
The chronic health impacts discussed in this paper are those caused by exposure to the common classes of chemical pesticides such as organochlorines, organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids, triazines, and neonicotinoids, as well as current results addressing those effects. This is due to the present literature's considerable discussion of the health impacts (Nicolopoulou-Stamati et al., 2016). The chemical classes, structures, and receptors to which they bind and show adverse effects, acute oral and dermal LD50 values, and examples of pesticides are given in Table 2."
,,"3.1. Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs)
Organochlorines are substances having at least one chlorine atom bound by a covalent bond. These have an extensive range of structural variations and chemical characteristics. Owing to the greater atomic weight of chlorine, it is observed that these compounds are denser than water. Hydrogen chloride, chlorine, and other chlorinating chemicals can be used to make these compounds. The broad family of organochlorine pesticides has been known to cause serious adverse health effects, including hematological and hepatic changes, endocrine abnormalities (Mnif et al., 2011), effects on developing embryos, and metabolism of lipids (Karami-Mohajeri and Abdollahi, 2011). The risk of developing cancers of the breast, lung, cervix, prostate, endometrium, hypospadias, and cryptorchidism is significantly increased by the bioaccumulation of different OCPs (Keswani et al., 2022; Rani et al., 2021). Organochlorines can enter the body through the skin, lungs, or gut wall. While dicofol, DDT, mirex, toxaphene, and methoxychlor are less absorbed via the skin than cyclodienes, hexachlorocyclohexane, endosulfan, and lindane (Singh et al., 2016). Fat and fat solvents have been found to significantly boost the absorption of organochlorines through the epidermis and gut wall (Singh et al., 2016). These volatile substances are primarily deposited in fat tissue and eliminated through the biliary and urine systems, although stored lipophilic substances may be eliminated via breast milk (Singh et al., 2016). DDT also inhibits the opening of potassium gates, stops sodium ion channels from shutting, and targets a particular neuronal adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase). Studies have shown that DDT can inhibit the movement of calcium ions, which is necessary for the body to release neurotransmitters at a slower rate and so improve signal transmission across synapses. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that DDT may affect the reproductive system by altering the androgenic or estrogenic systems. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) currently classifies DDT as a carcinogen, a substance that can cause cancer. It was recently reported that DDT exposure was linked to the emergence of autism, a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is common in children and has sharply increased in recent years. Humans are susceptible to effects after prolonged and intense exposure. Organochlorines may also interact with androgen and estrogen receptors, which are endocrine. Numerous indications of their poisoning include headache, nausea, vomiting, tremors, lack of coordination, and mental confusion were also documented. Gas-liquid chromatographic assays can be used to identify organochlorine compounds (OCCs) in blood. Early exposure stages can be used to take effective action to treat negative consequences. Some of the medications used to treat organochlorine toxicity include diazepam, lorazepam, and cholestyramine resin (Singh et al., 2016). Additionally, it has been proved that DDT and its active metabolite DDE (p,p-dichloro-diphenyl-dichloroethylene), may possess the ability to interrupt the endocrinal system which may lead to the development of cancer (Wan et al., 2022). Children's neurodevelopment has been linked to in-utero exposure to both DDE and DDT (Jusko et al., 2012). In addition, a recent study linked DDE to rat liver lipid abnormalities (Rodriguez-Alcala et al., 2015). Fig. 3 depicts various effects of OCP poisoning on human beings."
,,"3.2. Organophosphorus pesticides (OPs)
Organophosphates which were marketed as an environment-friendly substitute for organochlorines, incorporate a wider range of pesticides, glyphosate being the most common. Among the other well-known insecticides in this class are dimethoate, malathion, and parathion; some of them are recognized for their propensity to cause endocrine disruption (Gasnier et al., 2009; Mnif et al., 2011). They are related to problems with the neurological and endocrine systems and cellular oxidative stress, as well as effects on the normal functioning of enzymes like cholinesterase enzymes (Agrawal and Sharma, 2010), decreased secretion of insulin, dysregulation of cellular metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, severe genotoxic effects (Li et al., 2015), and harmful effects on normal mitochondrial functions (Karami-Mohajeri and Abdollahi, 2011). Several population-based studies showed that there is a potential link between exposure to organophosphates and diseases of the cardiovascular system (Hung et al., 2015), detrimental effects on male reproductive health as well as on the nervous system (Samsel and Seneff, 2013). The dementia, and potentially high chance for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma also reported in literature (ben Khadda et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2015). Additionally, shorter gestational durations have also been associated with fetal exposure to organophosphates (Jusko et al., 2012) and the development of neurological issues in children (Rauh et al., 2015). The most frequently used herbicide in modern agriculture is glyphosate, whose safety is still under debate among scientists (Gasnier et al., 2009). This is especially true since genetically modified crops that are glyphosate-tolerant, such as several varieties of soy and maize, have been introduced (Thongprakaisang et al., 2013). It has sparked worries related to probable synergistic estrogenic effects because of the concurrent contact with phytoestrogen known as “genistein,” which is a type of isoflavone found in soybeans and its related products. This is because glyphosate is widely used in the cultivation of genetically modified soybeans (Bøhn et al., 2014). Glyphosate can cause disturbance in endocrine system functioning (Swanson et al., 2014; Thongprakaisang et al., 2013) having an impact on human erythrocytes (Kwiatkowska et al., 2014), and rise the carcinogenicity of mouse skin (George et al., 2010). The shikimate pathway, generally found in bacteria, plants, and human gut microorganisms, is thought to be severely disrupted by glyphosate. The disturbance of the shikimate pathway may have an impact on how essential amino acids are provided to humans (Samsel and Seneff, 2013). The active ingredient (aminomethyl phosphonic acid) alone is thought to be less hazardous than commercial glyphosate formulations (Kwiatkowska et al., 2014; Thongprakaisang et al., 2013). Herbicides containing glycerophosphate, such as the well-known “Roundup,” can harm cultured human cutaneous cells (Parthasarathy et al., 2018), cause damage to DNA of human cells (Gasnier et al., 2009), function as endocrine disruptors in rat testicular cells, and provoke cell death in testicular cells of the animals involved in the experiment (Clair et al., 2012). Evidence also suggests that they may affect the intracellular transport and cytoskeleton of the cell (Hedberg and Wallin, 2010).

The OP is known to inhibit several esterase enzymes, including butyrylcholinesterases (BuChEs), a class of “orphan enzymes” that were initially believed to have no specific physiological functions but, were later found to have an impact on emotional behaviors. Exogenous administration of carboxylesterases (CEs) and BuChEs as bio-scavengers to prevent AChE inhibition, which is thought to be the primary cause of OP's harmful effects. The typical course of treatment for OP poisoning consists of two main stages: Supportive care may include resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, decontamination, and hemodialysis, if necessary. Atropine acts as the primary antidote, oximes, are used as a follow-up or in conjunction with atropine to reactivate AChE, benzodiazepines, that act as anticonvulsants, and pyridostigmine, which act as the main preventative, are the only products for the treatment of OP poisoning that have received food and drug administration (FDA) approval. Investigations on more recent countermeasures included glycopyrrolate, whose lower toxicity profile suggested to combine with atropine. Human butyrylcholinesterase (HuBChE) was the main enzyme has the highest potential to evaluate several bio-scavengers to use them as prophylactic agents (Alozi and Rawas-Qalaji, 2020). Fig. 4 indicates various harmful effects of organophosphate pesticides on humans. Fig. 5 shows the binding of Chlorpyrifos, and Dimethoate in the active site of acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AchE).
"
,,"In the in silico study, Chlorpyrifos showed a −81.9521 Dock score, and exhibited four protein-ligand interactions i.e. mainly, hydrogen bonding (H-bond) interactions with Tyr 124 (2.85 Å, 2.92 Å, and 3.34 Å) and Tyr 337 (2.84 Å) involving nitrogen and oxygen molecules of the drug candidate. Further, dimethoate depicted four hydrogen bonding with aromatic amino acid residues such as Tyr 124 (2: 3.57 Å and 2.99 Å), Tyr 337 (1: 3.02 Å), and Phe 295 (1: 2.87 Å) with the dock score of 47.8124. The docking interactions depicted that these molecules can bind with the protein target, effectively. Further, the study also depicted that Tyr 124 and Tyr 337 were crucial amino acids for the protein-ligand interaction. The study also concluded that the molecule can also interact with the protein target of humans which may affect their health.

3.3. Carbamate pesticides
Pest management in agriculture frequently employs a group of compounds known as carbamate insecticides. Carbamates are a class of insecticides that share structural and mechanistic similarities with organophosphate pesticides. They belong to a subgroup called N-methyl carbamates, derived from carbamic acid, thiocarbamic acid, and dithiocarbamic acid. The key distinction between carbamates and organophosphates lies in their interaction with acetylcholinesterase enzyme. Carbamates can reversibly bind to acetylcholinesterase, whereas organophosphates irreversibly phosphorylate the acetylcholinesterase. The frequently employed carbamate pesticides are carbaryl, carbofuran, and amino carbamates (Atrache El et al., 2016). These pesticides function by preventing the activity of an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase, which is necessary for the healthy functioning of the nervous system in human, animals, and insects. The carbamate molecule carbamylates a hydroxyl group of serine residue in the enzyme's active site (Darvesh et al., 2008). ACh accumulates at CNS synapses, parasympathetic effector sites, and neuromuscular junctions when AChE is inhibited. The carbamylated enzyme undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis, which results in the restoration of AChE activity. Compared to the reversal of AChE's interaction with OP pesticides, this happens quite quickly. The influence on AChE activity of the cerebral region is far smaller than that generated by OP insecticides because there is no “aging” and many carbamates experience trouble in crossing the blood-brain barrier. Many harmful and deadly impacts on the health of human beings and the environment have been connected to the utilization of carbamate insecticides. These insecticides can be hazardous to humans and animals, if consumed or absorbed via the skin which is one of the main issues with them. According to a research report, prolonged exposure to carbamate insecticides might cause neurological damage and raise the risk of developing certain cancers, including leukemia and lymphoma (Ataei and Abdollahi, 2022). Carbamate pesticides have endocrine-disrupting properties that include disrupting the male reproductive system by upsetting the hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis (HPT axis) (Waye and Trudeau, 2011), possible reproductive complications, and impacts on cellular metabolic processes. The capacity of insecticides such as carbamates to cause human immune cells to undergo apoptosis and necrosis (Li et al., 2011), natural killer cells (Li et al., 2012), as well as apoptosis in T lymphocytes, has also been demonstrated in vitro investigations on hamster ovarian cells and human immune cells (Li et al., 2011). It has also been shown that the pesticide carbaryl, which belongs to the carbamate class, can bind to the hepatic aryl hydrocarbon receptor, a transcription factor involved in the process of dioxin poisoning. Additionally, it has been proved that carbamate pesticides can have an impact on neurobehavioral functioning, increase the chances of dementia (Lin et al., 2015), and result in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (Zheng et al., 2016a).

Commercial formulations, not isolated active components, are virtually always involved in pesticide poisoning, and they frequently increase the toxicity (Eddleston et al., 2008). Systemic toxicity may result through consuming, inhalation, or skin contamination, and propoxur has been linked to severe neonatal poisoning by transplacental transfer (Kovacic and Somanathan, 2012). The toxicity of each member of the group differs a lot, therefore they must not be regarded as toxicologically innocuous; and they can cause serious acute poisoning, lethal, or deadly even though carbamate poisoning is often less severe than OP intoxication (King and Aaron, 2015). The death rate in a single group was similar (17.6 % and 9.5 %, respectively) when 42 World Health Organization and 17 methomyl poisonings class I OP pesticide poisonings (methidathion, phosphamidon, dichlorvos, parathion) were retrospectively compared (Lee et al., 2011). Pesticides containing carbamates may harm the ecosystem as well. These substances have the potential to contaminate soil and water, affecting ecosystems and wildlife. Studies have revealed that carbamate insecticides can have an impact on growing and developing plants, along with the behavior and reproduction of aquatic species (Chowdhury et al., 2012; Kadiru et al., 2022). Aldicarb, a carbamate insecticide frequently used to manage pests on crops, is one illustration of the detrimental consequences of carbamates on the health of human beings and the environment. Aldicarb was found to be detrimental to the growth and survival of monarch butterfly larvae (Greiner, 2022). Carbamate herbicides have the potential to harm both the health of human beings and the environment, significantly. To comprehend the enduring impacts of such chemicals and to create safer and more sustainable pest control techniques, more research is required, decontamination needs to happen as quickly as feasible due to the ongoing cutaneous absorption of carbamate insecticides.

Medical professionals should wear personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent self-contamination. Gloves made of nitrile or neoprene offer sufficient protection against cutaneous exposures, and the healthcare provider should wear full protective equipment, at the very least a gown, mask, and face shield. Insecticide protection from latex gloves is insufficient. The patients should be stripped of all clothing, and their skin should be cleaned three times: once with water, once with soap, and once again with water. In cases of GI ingestion, vomiting, and diarrhea may lead to cutaneous absorption in healthcare professionals (Silberman and Taylor, 2023). Fig. 6 displays weak hydrogen bonding interactions between Aldicarb and aromatic amino acid Tyr124 (2: 3.09 Å and 2.63 Å) and one strong hydrogen bonding interaction with Tyr337 (2.67 Å) of acetylcholinesterase enzyme. In the in silico study, aldicarb showed a high dock score (−64.9396) and demonstrated three significant hydrogen bonding interactions.
"
,,"3.4. Pyrethroids
A class of synthetic organic chemicals known as pyrethroids (PYRs) imitate the natural pyrethrins. They are still widely used because of their low toxicity and persistence in mammals. Compared to other insecticides, PYRs have higher lipophilicity, which enables them to cross the blood-brain barrier and cause direct toxic effects on the central nervous system (Hao et al., 2023). In terms of chemistry, pyrethroid pesticides are chrysanthemic acid's esters (ethyl 2,2-dimethyl-3-(1-isobutenyl) cyclopropane-1-carboxylate) (Ahamad and Kumar, 2023). Pyrethroid pesticides target the receptor site of the voltage-gated sodium channel. By attaching to sodium channels, they render insects, make them incapable of moving, and paralyze them, excitably. They also alter the membrane potential, resulting in nerve cells that are abnormally stable in their hyperexcitability. Insects are subjected to “knockdown,” a non-lethal incapacitating effect, as a result of these modifications (Ahamad and Kumar, 2023). Pyrethroids frequently take the role of limited or outlawed insecticides like organophosphates in residential and agricultural settings. The main pyrethroids that are sold commercially are bifenthrin, allethrin, cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, resmethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, deltamethrin, d-phenothrin, permethrin, and tetramethrin (Saillenfait et al., 2015). Pyrethroids are widely distributed throughout the body, including kidneys, liver, stomach, intestine, adipose tissues, and nervous system. Despite being lipophilic, no bioaccumulation was seen in mammals after subacute dosing. They are typically not well absorbed through the skin and are quickly broken down in the liver through phase-II metabolic reactions such as ester cleavage, hydroxylation, and conjugation. A variety of hydrophilic metabolites are excreted through urine (Ramchandra et al., 2019). Small dust particles and other surfaces can adsorb pyrethroids, making them potential indoor toxicants. Epigastric discomfort, headache, nausea, exhaustion, anorexia, increased stromal secretion, muscle fasciculation, and vomiting occur within 10 min to one hour of ingesting this toxin. Additionally, convulsive episodes, altered state of consciousness, dyspnea, cyanosis, and pulmonary edema are the most common symptoms in severe cases of intentional poisoning (Chandra et al., 2013). Even though the acute poisoning of pyrethroids in humans is minimal, they are powerful neurotoxicants in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals. Due to their quick biotransformation and eliminate from the body as inactive metabolites, primarily in urine (Chandra et al., 2013). Sensorimotor polyneuropathy in the lower limbs, Cerebral-organ illnesses, and vegetative nervous disorders, such as paroxysmal tachycardia, enhanced temperature sensitivity, and poorer exercise tolerance linked to circulatory dysfunction, are all chronic pyrethroid side effects (Pathak et al., 2021). The actions of agonists at chloride channels should be antagonistic to those of pyrethroids, according to knowledge of the pharmacology of pyrethroid compounds. Ivermectin is one such substance, and studies on animals have demonstrated that it decreases salivation. Similar to the majority of agricultural chemicals, proper product labeling, storage, and packaging are crucial for preventing poisoning. Thus, occupational exposure could be reduced. Fig. 7 depicts the toxic effects of pyrethroid pesticides.

Fig. 7"
,,"3.5. Other classes of chemical pesticides
A distinct class of chemical pesticides known as triazines, which would include atrazine, simazine, and ametryn, all of which associated with reproductive and endocrinal disruptions (Mnif et al., 2011). Furthermore, it was shown that triazine pesticides and the occurrence of breast cancer can be statistically related. The most widely used triazine type of compound is atrazine which is a strong herbicide with dopaminergic effects connected to oxidative stress and cytotoxicity. They can affect animals' behavior and reproductive aspects, particularly, the endocrine system. The most widely used insecticides are neonicotinoid pesticides like thiacloprid, imidacloprid, and guadipyr, are relatively new and were initially marketed as they appeared to have reduced hazard to untargeted organisms. Still, there is a ton of evidence that suggests the opposite; one frequent illustration is their impact on bees. It is reported that the reproductive and endocrine systems of animals may be affected severely. A research study shows that neonicotinoids can enhance the production of an enzyme called aromatase, which is associated with cancer of the breast and is proven to be crucial for the development of the breast cancer (Nicolopoulou-Stamati et al., 2016).

4. Natural pesticides
Natural pesticides are natural materials that work as killers or repellents to reduce, destroy, and kill pests such as insects, fungi, weeds, and other unwanted organisms that affect human health, crops, and the environment (Mfarrej and Rara, 2019). It is very crucial to remember that natural pesticides may continue to have detrimental effects on the environment and human health. Overall, natural pesticides can be a useful tool in pest management, but it is important to use them cautiously and follow label instructions to minimize the potential negative influence on the health of human and the environment. Natural pesticides have huge probable adverse effects on both the environment and the health of human beings. Some of these effects might be comparable to those caused by artificial pesticides, while others might be specific to organic pesticides.

4.1. Pyrethrum
Pyrethrum is a natural pesticide that is derived from the chrysanthemum plant. It works well against a variety of insects, including ticks, flies, and mosquitoes. Pyrethrum causes sensitivity and irritation on injured skin, which are exacerbated by sunlight. Pyrethrum is slowly absorbed through the skin, intestines, and stomach. Humans more readily absorb pyrethrum through their lungs while breathing. Depending on the quantity of pyrethrum utilized, the response seems to vary. High concentrations of pyrethrum in the air can cause symptoms like asthmatic breathing, sneezing, stuffy nose, headache, nausea, lack of coordination, tremors, convulsions, face swelling, flushing, and burning of skin (Zhang et al., 2021). There could be dysphagia, increased secretions, and/or mouth ulcers systemic effects start to show (4–8 h after exposure). Palpitations, tightening of the chest, and impaired vision are less frequent, while weariness, headaches, and dizziness are more prevalent. The main characteristics that pose a threat to life are coma and convulsions.

Neem oil, for instance, has been discovered to linger in the soil for up to three months (Kumar, 2016). The pesticide residue may still be present in the soil when the crop is planted, if the natural pesticide is used on crops that are cultivated in rotation with other crops. Natural pesticides may also harm insects, birds, and other creatures that are not intended as targets. Neem oil can be poisonous to aquatic insects like mayflies and water fleas (Zhou, 2016). If birds or other wildlife ingest crops or other plants that have been treated with pesticides, some natural pesticides may also be dangerous to them. Since pests can acquire resistance to natural pesticides just like they can to synthetic pesticides, using natural pesticides to manage pest populations may become less successful over time (Attia et al., 2013). Given that the possibility of resistance rises with increased use, this can be especially problematic when natural pesticides are applied frequently or across sizable regions. Some natural pesticides may also be contaminated with synthetic pesticides or other hazardous chemicals due to contamination during manufacturing or as a consequence of the presence of these substances in the environment (Ramalho, 2015). Some organic insecticides operate by making bugs sick when they consume them or absorb them via their skin. For instance, pyrethrins, a type of natural insecticide derived from chrysanthemum flowers, paralyze and kill insects by interfering with their neurological systems (Zhang et al., 2021).

Some natural insecticides target bugs by physically interrupting them. A natural insecticide formed from the fossilized remnants of microscopic aquatic organisms called diatoms is diatomaceous earth. It functions by removing the exoskeleton's outer covering, which causes an insect to get dehydrated and perish (Sarwar, 2016). Some organic pesticides function by eradicating or preventing the development of microorganisms like bacteria or fungi. The natural fungicide copper sulfate prevents the growth of bacteria and fungi, hence preventing their ability to infect plants with illness (Rai et al., 2018). Rather than killing pests, some natural insecticides operate by driving them away. Neem oil from the neem tree, is frequently used as a natural insect repellant. It functions by ejecting a potent odor that repels insects, stopping them from eating plants or laying eggs (Mani, 2022; Sun et al., 2020).

Pyrethrins cause neurological harm that quickly infiltrate an insect's nervous system, interfering with both the peripheral and central nervous systems and paralyzing them. The insect is rendered immobile and unable to fly for a short time after application. Eventually, this causes it to die or recover as a result of enzymatic detoxification involving oxidation (Krief, 2021). The keto alcoholic esters of chrysanthemic and pyrethroic acid give pyrethrins their Insecticidal properties. Due to their strong lipophilic existence, these acids quickly penetrate a wide variety of insects and pests and paralyze their nervous systems (Pathak et al., 2022). Despite their immediate poisonous effects, pyrethrins can be quickly metabolized (broken down) by a variety of insects. These insects might recover after a brief paralysis rather than perish. Most pyrethrin-containing treatments also contain the synergist piperonyl butoxide to stop insects from metabolizing pyrethrins and healing from poisoning (Egwu Oguh et al., 2019).

4.2. Neem
The seeds and leaves of the neem tree are used to make natural neem insecticide. Ants, beetles, and mites are just a few of the many insects killed by neem, effectively. Although some people may experience mild skin sensitivity or allergic reactions, hence, thought to be low toxicity for both humans and animals (Mfarrej and Rara, 2019). Neem has demonstrated some therapeutic effects on plant diseases and insect pests. Neem has been shown to have powerful biological properties that inhibit the growth of microorganisms and cause their cell walls to fall apart (Adusei and Azupio, 2022). Neem is most effective as a feeding inhibitor in insects, although it can also operate as a repellant, growth regulator, oviposition (egg deposition) suppressor, sterilant, or poison in different forms. The chemical ingredients of neem are taken up systemically by plants through the roots in soil drench treatments. The active components for biological activity are diluted, yet it remains unchanged and spreads uniformly to actively growing plant portions. On insects and pathogens, systemically treated plants have antifeedant, oviposition deterrent, growth-inhibiting effects, and other biological properties. Depending on the test plant or insect species, the degree of systematicity and the effect on insects vary (Adusei and Azupio, 2022). Neem is a growth regulator that is suspected to interfere with chitin formation, disrupting normal development and vary in their susceptibility (Egwu Oguh et al., 2019).

4.3. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)
A bacterium Bt is a natural insecticide harmful to some insects such as caterpillars and beetles. It is regarded as both human and animal-safe, while some people may experience adverse reactions (Rubio-Infante and Moreno-Fierros, 2016).

4.4. Spinosad
It is a natural insecticide produced when a soil bacterium ferments. It works well against a variety of insects, including mites, aphids, and caterpillars. Although some people may experience mild skin sensitivity or allergy reactions, it is usually thought to be less toxic to both humans and animals (Arena et al., 2018).

4.5. Rotenone
Rotenone is a naturally occurring insecticide generated from the roots of Lonchocarpus species. It works well against a variety of insects, such as flies, beetles, and aphids. It is usually less toxic to both humans and animals but some people may experience mild skin sensitivity or allergy reactions (Singh et al., 2018). The mechanism through which nutritional molecules are converted into energy at the cellular level is called cellular respiration, and rotenone is a potent inhibitor of this process. It prevents ubiquinone from receiving electrons from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) (Egwu Oguh et al., 2019).

5. Molecular mechanisms relating pesticide exposure to chronic diseases
5.1. Gene-related harm
Genotoxicity is characterized as an adverse impact on the integrity of cells genetic material (chromosome, DNA, or RNA). It describes the characteristics of chemical agents that harm a cell's genetic material, resulting in mutations that could cause cancer. Genotoxins are mutagenic chemicals, and exposure to them increases the risk of developing tumors, hormonal changes, DNA damage, and changes in the ovaries and eggs, all of which leading to cancers (Kapeleka et al., 2021) They are researched under genetic toxicology, and various genotoxicity assays can be used to identify them. Epidemiological and experimental investigations have gathered crucial information about the genetic toxicity of pesticides using many types of tests, such as chromosomal abnormalities, sister chromatid swaps, micronucleus, and comet assay (Mostafalou and Abdollahi, 2013). The risk of DNA damage surges with increased genotoxicity in people exposed to pesticides at work. DNA single- and double-strand breaks, oxidative stress, and crosslinks may be caused by persistent and sublethal exposure to complex pesticide mixtures (Kapeleka et al., 2021). Although exposure to pesticides is known to cause oxidative stress, epigenetic modifications, and altered gut microbiota, their biological effects appear to be primarily influenced by the presence of genetic polymorphisms. Particularly, the influence of genetic polymorphisms may make some people more vulnerable to the oxidative stress brought on by pesticides. The most prevalent polymorphisms of cytochrome P450, glutathione transferases [including glutathione S-transferase μ1 (GSTM1), glutathione S-transferase π1 (GSTP1), glutathione S-transferase θ1 (GSTT1)], acetyltransferases (NAT2), and paraoxonases (mostly PON1), which are primarily involved in the metabolism of organophosphorus compounds, can be studied to determine the susceptibility to exposure (Teodoro et al., 2019). To completely understand the tumorigenic and carcinogenic pathways of pesticides, additional studies on the genotoxicity of pesticides are required, taking into account genetic damage as one of the early events for the induction and progression of cancer. On the other hand, recent research suggested that pesticides may control gene expression through DNA methylation and the de-regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs). There has been a lot of bioinformatics data generated on this topic. Additionally, new computational methods have been developed to locate in silico-specific miRNAs or methylation hotspots linked to the presence of disease or to be used as bio-indicators of pesticide exposure (Teodoro et al., 2019).

5.2. Aggregation of proteins
A key biological process essential to the upkeep and control the cellular function is the degradation of damaged, misfolded, or unnecessary proteins. Autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which primarily target short-lived protein molecules via proteases and the lysosomal apparatus, respectively, are the two main cellular processes for protein degradation (Pohl and Dikic, 2019). Ubiquitin is used for protein tagging, and proteasomes are used for the breakdown of proteins. Dysregulation of this system is linked to the pathogenesis of several chronic illnesses, primarily cancer, and neurodegenerative processes, as shown by changes in proteasome activity (Zheng et al., 2016b). The emergence of neurodegenerative diseases has been linked to environmental exposure to specific pesticides and proteasomal dysfunction. It has been shown that the organochlorine insecticide dieldrin decreases proteasome activity and increases sensitivity to the likelihood of death in dopaminergic neurons (Sharma et al., 2010). Fig. 8 presents various molecular mechanisms of pesticides resulting into chronic diseases."
,,"6. Conclusions
Pesticides are a broad category of substances with a range of acute and chronic toxicity. Chemical pesticides can pose risks to human health, especially for those who handle or are exposed to them regularly, such as farmers and agricultural workers. Many research studies indicate that pesticides may cause long-term health issues such as neurodevelopmental or behavioral issues, birth defects, asthma, and cancer in humans. Different classes of pesticides including organochlorides, organophosphorus, carbamates, pyrethroids, and others bind to different receptors like estrogen receptors, GABA, EGFR, etc., which ultimately are responsible for the side effects when exposure is beyond their LD50 either orally or through the skin. Studies suggest that pesticides may harm children's long-term health, including birth defects, cancer, asthma, and neurodevelopmental or behavioral problems. To protect fetuses, newborns, and children from harmful effects, efforts should be made to minimize exposure to hazardous substances and to ensure that products released to the market have undergone a thorough safety assessment to protect the general public health and safety. Integrated pest management practices, which combine various pest control techniques, including natural pesticides, can provide effective and sustainable pest management solutions. It is worthwhile to consider nature-derived pesticides over chemical pesticides, if used judiciously and with a proper understanding of their application, timing, and potential risks. So, there is a need to explore and develop natural pesticides that can have targeted effects only. An in silico approach is utilized to check the binding affinities of some existing pesticides with human proteins. The binding interactions of Chlorpyrifos, Dimethoate, and Aldicarb in the active site of AchE are explored to understand the possible mechanisms responsible for the side effects like breast cancer, migraines, blurry vision, salivation, etc. Thus, computational drug design and discovery techniques and virtual screening of libraries for natural chemical constituents/compounds must be involved in the exploration of newer targeted environment-friendly pesticides that are less harmful to the health and environment.

Risk assessment of pesticide impacts on remote ecosystems makes use of model-estimated degradation in air. Recent studies suggest these degradation rates to be overestimated, questioning current pesticide regulation. Here, we investigated the concentrations of 76 pesticides in Europe at 29 rural, coastal, mountain, and polar sites during the agricultural application season. Overall, 58 pesticides were observed in the European atmosphere. Low spatial variation of 7 pesticides suggests continental-scale atmospheric dispersal. Based on concentrations in free tropospheric air and at Arctic sites, 22 pesticides were identified to be prone to long-range atmospheric transport, which included 15 substances approved for agricultural use in Europe and 7 banned ones. Comparison between concentrations at remote sites and those found at pesticide source areas suggests long atmospheric lifetimes of atrazine, cyprodinil, spiroxamine, tebuconazole, terbuthylazine, and thiacloprid. In general, our findings suggest that atmospheric transport and persistence of pesticides have been underestimated and that their risk assessment needs to be improved.

Synopsis
Atmospheric pesticide presence and levels in remote areas mirror those in continental Europe, calling into question the current risk assessment assumptions related to degradation in air.

Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Pesticides are synthetic chemicals used for their toxic effects. (1) Their agricultural use has significantly increased globally from 2.4 million tons in 1990 to 4.1 million tons in 2020. (2,3) Chemicals authorized for pesticidal use vary widely in their chemical structures and physicochemical properties. (4,5) Since the 1960s, growing environmental and health concerns have led to usage restrictions of the previously dominant organochlorine pesticides, to their substitution by more biodegradable ones, and, where possible, to less intensive application. (6) Because of the toxicity of pesticides and their metabolites to nontarget organisms, environmental exposure to pesticides is a concern. (7,8) Upon bioaccumulation and biomagnification, lipophilic pesticides (with an octanol–water partition coefficient KOW of > 105) may reach effect levels in top predators and humans. (9−11)
Most pesticides are semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs). (10) They enter the atmosphere upon application via direct emission from spray drift, through wind erosion of soil particles containing pesticides, and via volatilization from soil, vegetation, or water surfaces. (3,12−14) Currently used pesticides have been found in rural air (15−17) and ecosystems (18,19) but have also been observed far from the sources, at high mountains, (20) in the marine boundary layer, (21,22) and in the Arctic. (10,23,24) Such observations have been sporadic because unlike organochlorine pesticides, these pesticides are rarely included in air-monitoring programs (in Europe apart from France and Sweden (25)).
Evidence for long-range transport to remote areas is one of the criteria for a chemical to be considered a persistent organic pollutant (POP). (26,27) Unlike organochlorine pesticides (e.g., DDT, lindane) which are classified as POPs, it has been largely considered that the new generation of pesticides, currently in use globally, are not prone to long-range atmospheric transport (LRAT) due to their short atmospheric half-lives (i.e., <2 days). (27) The atmospheric lifetime of SVOCs is determined by gas/particle partitioning and their reactivity in the gaseous and particulate phases and, if degradation is resisted in Earth surface compartments, might be enhanced by multiple cycles of deposition and revolatilization (grasshopper effect). (28,29) However, gas/particle partitioning of currently used pesticides is incompletely understood and experimental data for reactions with atmospheric oxidants are available for only few substances. (30−35) Without such data, degradability in air is often assessed based on model-estimated reactivity with the hydroxyl (OH) radical in the homogeneous gas phase. (36) However, recent findings have shown the presence of pesticides with theoretical persistence in air below the LRAT potential threshold also in remote areas. (22−24) This questions the accuracy of the pesticide risk assessment in Europe to protect the atmospheric environment and remote ecosystems, which considers only the atmospheric half-life, for which only the modeled reactivity with the OH radical in the gas phase is considered.
Here, taking advantage of air-monitoring infrastructures, we present the continental-scale distributions of 76 pesticides in the atmosphere over Europe. To this end, 77 particulate and 17 gas-phase samples were collected during the main pesticide application period in spring 2020 at 29 rural, coastal, mountain, and polar sites across Europe and the European Arctic (Figure S1 and Table S1).

Sampling Sites
The contributing 29 sampling sites (Table S1) are observational platforms of the Aerosol, Clouds and Trace Gases Research Infrastructure (ACTRIS, www.actris.eu/) and/or the Co-operative Programme for Monitoring and Evaluation of the Long-range Transmission of Air Pollutants in Europe (EMEP, www.emep.int/) and have long-term expertise with atmospheric aerosol particle and trace gas sampling. These 29 sampling sites are located in 17 different European countries and in the European Arctic (Figure S1) and were classified as rural (n = 16), coastal (n = 4), mountain (n = 6), and polar (n = 3) based on their geographical characteristics and/or land use analysis. Indeed, the mountain and polar sites were defined based on their geographical characteristics with, respectively, an altitude of >2000 m a.s.l. and a latitude of >67°N. In the second step, the type of land use surrounding each sampling site (10 km radius) was characterized using the CORINE Land Cover 2018 for all sites except the Zeppelin Observatory for which the Global Land Cover 2000 was used (Table S2). (37) To this end, the many categories available from these databases were grouped into more relevant ones considering the aim of this study (Table S3). The coastal sites were defined as those having >35% of their surrounding areas (10 km radius) as water bodies, while for rural sites, it was >60% of agricultural land, forest and shrub, and/or herbaceous vegetation associations. In addition, the rural sites were subcategorized as agricultural-adjacent (A.) or nonagricultural-adjacent (N.A.) if their share of agricultural land in their surrounding area was above or below 45%, respectively.
Sampling
Sampling took place simultaneously at all 29 sites in the main pesticide application season in spring 2020 during three 48 h sampling periods (namely, 28–30/04, 12–14/05, and 26–28/05). Sampling was performed with active air samplers (low or high volume, based on on-site availability, Table S1). Due to Covid-19 epidemic-related restrictions in some countries, only 22 sites collected samples during all three sampling periods, while 4 and 3 sites collected samples during 2 and 1 sampling period, respectively (Table S1).
All sites collected the particulate phase on quartz fiber filters (QFF, QM-A, Whatman, U.K.), preferentially (but not always) with a PM10 inlet, as CUPs have previously been found in both the fine and coarse particles. (15) In addition, six sites (ADA, BKO, KOS, SBO, UFS, and ZPO) sampled also the gaseous phase on a sandwich sorbent (i.e., PUF/XAD2/PUF sandwich), consisting of a polyurethane foam plug (PUF, Molitan a.s., Czech Republic, density 0.030 g cm–3, 5 cm depth, diameter of 5.5/11 cm for the low/high-volume air sampler), a layer of XAD resin (Supelpak-2, Supelco), and another PUF plug, separated by cotton wool. This sandwich configuration has been shown to be the most efficient for the collection of gaseous pesticides. (38) Prior to sampling, PUFs and XAD2 were precleaned via Soxhlet extraction with acetone for 8 h, followed by 8 h of extraction in methanol. All sampling media were provided by RECETOX and shipped to the sites. In total, 77 samples and 35 field blank samples were collected (i.e., 77 QFFs and 17 PUF/XAD2/PUF sandwiches) and kept in the freezer at −18 °C until extraction.
Sample Preparation, Analysis, and QAQC
All samples underwent spiking with labeled standards (Table S4) before extraction. The extraction process involved using an automatic extractor (Büchi Extraction System, B-811, Switzerland) with 5 mM ammonium acetate in methanol. The extraction process consisted of 1 h of warm Soxhlet, followed by 1 h of solvent rinsing, and a concentration step to 1 mL using nitrogen. After centrifugation for 10 min (12,000 G, Z-36 HK, Hermle Labortechnik, Germany) within polypropylene tubes (Corning Costar Spin-X), the extracts were filtered (cellulose acetate membrane and 0.22 μm pore size) and further concentrated to 0.5 mL under nitrogen.
Postextraction, the samples were divided into three 100 μL aliquots, each undergoing a different analysis. The three analyses allowed the quantification of 76 pesticides (35 herbicides, 22 insecticides, and 19 fungicides) (Table S5). Among these pesticides, 40 are approved for agricultural use in Europe, 22 are among the most globally used pesticides, 34 are characterized as priority active ingredients to be monitored in France, 13 are highly hazardous pesticides, and 25 are high-risk pesticides.
To ensure quality assurance, field blanks were analyzed alongside air samples collected. Blank levels of most individual analytes were generally below or low (Tables S6 and S7). Procedural recoveries were assessed by spiking sampling media with native standards and their corresponding isotopic-labeled standards, followed by processing as per sample. Most procedural recoveries fell within the range of 60–120% with standard deviations below 20%, except for a few exceptions.
Detailed information about the procedures is provided in the Supporting Information.
Air Mass Origin
The Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART (39) was used to identify the potential source regions by calculating the residence times in the surface layer of air sampled.
The meteorological data used (0.5 and 1° and 3 h horizontal and temporal resolutions, 137 vertical levels) were obtained from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (www.ecmwf.int, last access: 21/06/2022). For each simulation, 100,000 particles were continuously released from the sites at the ground level for the polar sites and at altitudes ranging 190–210 m agl for mountain sites and were followed for 30 and 10 days backward in time at polar sites and mountain sites, respectively (Figures S2–S5).
Advection to Mountain Sites
For the six high-mountain sites, the advection was characterized using various combinations of on-site tracer measurements and meteorological data and modeling. For all mountain sites, the conclusions on the planetary boundary layer (PBL) influence on the sampled air were based on the site-specific experiences (Table S8).
At CPK, regional chemistry-transport modeling data (ALADIN model, 2 km × 2 km horizontal resolution) (40) were used to judge whether the sampled air was within the free troposphere (FT) or within the PBL. The CPK site was within the FT during most of the sampling time. However, due to short-term (<1 h) liftings of the inversion (which occurred 2, 10, and 2 times during the sampling periods 1, 2, and 3, respectively), PBL air was mixed into all three air samples.
The model terrain is ca. 500 m below the true altitude. Moreover, due to resolution limitations of the model, in particular, in complex terrain, upslope movement of air from valleys will be systematically underestimated. For HAC, the on-site gaseous (i.e., CO, CO2) and aerosol tracer measurements, meteorological parameters, and planetary boundary layer height (obtained from ECMWF) were used. (41−43) Air collected during period 2 represented almost exclusively the FT. It was heavily affected by Sahara dust long-range transport. Sampling period 3 was characterized by relatively low and stable concentrations of specific tracers (i.e., aerosol absorption and particle number concentration), but the station was mostly in clouds, indicating conditions characteristic of the interface between FT and PBL. PBL influence on air collected cannot be excluded. No sample was collected during period 1. For JFJ, on-site Rn measurements (44) and data from a ceilometer, obtained at the foot of the site (measured at Kleine Scheidegg, altitude difference of 1510 m; 6 km direct distance from JFJ), (45) were used to judge free tropospheric vs boundary layer air. JFJ was above the planetary boundary layer during short periods in all three sampling periods. The samples represent mixed FT and PBL air. At PDM, the analysis of 222Rn measurements (α-detection) suggested mixed FT and PBL air during sampling period 3. No samples were collected during periods 1 and 2. For SBO, data from a ceilometer (Vaisala CL51) (46) obtained at the foot of the site (measured at Kolm-Saigurn, altitude difference of 1466 m; 5 km direct distance from SBO) were used to judge on FT vs PBL air. Heights for measuring periods with signals under the detection limit, which occurred during nighttime, were interpolated. The derived heights of the PBL were below SBO during all three sampling periods. No sample was collected during period 1. At UFS, the 222Rn measurements (α-detection) (47) suggested FT air with some PBL influence during the sampling periods 1 and 2 and almost exclusively FT air during sampling period 3. The attribution is supported by on-site measurements of humidity and other meteorological parameters. (48) In addition, advection and possible collection of FT air were investigated for two other elevated sites, i.e., RIG (Switzerland, 1031 m a.s.l.) and ZPO (Svalbard, 474 m a.s.l.). In situ and ceilometer data, (49) respectively, besides others, indicated that at both sites, the air collected during the three sampling periods was PBL air or PBL with little FT air mixed in.
Data Analysis
All the statistical analysis was performed using software GraphPad Prism (v9.0.0). For these analyses, when the concentration of a compound was lower than that of iLOD, iLOQ, or LOQb, these values were not taken into account. Substitutions of values below LOQ by LOQ/2 were used to determine the relative standard deviation (Table 1).

European Distribution of Atmospheric Pesticides
Out of the 76 pesticides targeted, 58 were found in the atmosphere, including the European Arctic. In the atmospheric particulate phase, 51, 38, 24, and 6 pesticides were found at rural, coastal, mountain, and polar sites, respectively (Figures S6–S8). Overall, the number of particulate pesticides decreases with latitude and increases with the proximity to agricultural fields (Figure 1). Among these 58 pesticides present in European air, about 50% were rarely found (1–5 sites), while around 20% were quantified in more than half of the sites investigated (Table S9).
Figure 1"
,,"Figure 2. Pesticide mean concentrations quantified at each site in the particulate (all sites) and gaseous phases (6 sites).

8 out of 11 pesticides exhibiting a quantification frequency exceeding 50% (Table S9) (i.e., cyprodinil, fenpropidin, fenpropimorph, metazachlor, S-metolachlor, spiroxamine, tebuconazole, and terbuthylazine) had their particulate concentrations spanning 3 to 6 orders of magnitude (log(cmax/cmin) = 3–6), while the other three (i.e., 2,4-D, atrazine, and thiacloprid) exhibited a more uniform distribution across the continent (log(cmax/cmin) ≈ 2 and RSD < 200%) (Table 1 and Figures S9 and S10). Moreover, for atrazine and thiacloprid, the concentration gradient from the source areas was particularly small: The average concentrations at remote sites (free tropospheric mountain and Arctic) were within an order of magnitude of the average concentrations at other sites (rural + coastal + mountain) (log(cos/crs) < 1; Table 1). The same was found for cyprodinil, spiroxamine, tebuconazole, and terbuthylazine. Such uniform distributions suggest that the atmospheric lifetime of the compounds is similarly long or its source distribution is similarly wide as that of atrazine. Atrazine, an herbicide banned since 2004, (50) continues to be present in European air, likely a consequence of its persistence and long-range transport from regions where it is still used. (3,51−53) Because of its persistence, atrazine keeps cycling in air, even 25 years after its ban in Europe. It is re-emitted from secondary sources, but primary sources outside Europe may also contribute. (54)
Among these frequently observed pesticides, 8 are approved for agricultural use in Europe, except for atrazine, fenpropimorph, and thiacloprid (Tables S5). Fenpropimorph is a fungicide banned shortly before our sampling campaign but remained authorized for use as a biocide until 2021. (55) Thiacloprid, banned for agricultural use in May 2020, is another exception. Among the less frequently found pesticides, acetochlor, carbaryl, and simazine, their European approvals had lapsed more than 9 years before our sampling. Interestingly, concentrations of these substances at remote sites did not significantly differ from those at rural sites by more than an order of magnitude (Table 1), indicating their persistence and long-range transport from regions where they are still in use, such as North America and Africa.
By hierarchical cluster analysis, we find a high degree of similarity in particulate pesticide substance patterns between sites far from application, i.e., polar and mountain sites, particularly evident during the third sampling period (Figures S11–S13).
Long-Range Atmospheric Transport (LRAT) of Pesticides
The substances prone to long-range atmospheric transport were identified using the samples collected at the polar sites as well as those collected at high mountain sites from free tropospheric air (see the Supporting Information for the determination of free tropospheric conditions at each site). Indeed, in the free troposphere, zonal and meridional transport is more efficient due to higher wind speeds and longer depositional lifetime. (56)
In the polar atmosphere, 19 pesticides were quantified, including 15 for which this is the first evidence of their potential to reach the Arctic. Out of these 19 pesticides, 12 were approved for agricultural use in Europe in 2020. In particular, most of these pesticides were quantified in the gas phase at the ZPO site, Svalbard (78.9°N). 13 pesticides were found in the four samples at mountain sites that were confirmed to have been collected exclusively in free tropospheric air (Table S8). This included 10 approved for agricultural use and 10 that were also found at the polar sites. Therefore, by combining the results from the polar and free tropospheric air samples, 22 pesticides were identified to be prone to LRAT (blue area in Figure 3), which included 15 approved for agricultural use in Europe.
Figure 3"
,,"Figure 3. Pesticides identified as prone to long-range atmospheric transport (blue area, FT = free tropospheric), pesticides quantified in the planetary boundary layer (white area), and pesticides never observed (gray area) ordered along model estimate of half-life in air. (36) Not pictured is one pesticide never observed, i.e., fluazinam, with a model-estimated half-life of 1956 h. Annual mean OH concentration of 7.5 × 105 cm−3 used for calculation of half-life in air.

Source regions, based on 30-day footprint analyses by the FLEXPART model, for the air collected from 28 to 30/04/2020 and 26–28/05/2020 at ZPO, Svalbard, are located in the North Atlantic and the inner Arctic (Figure S2) and contained the lowest number and concentrations of pesticides. Higher levels were quantified in the air collected from 12 to 14/05/2020 at ZPO, which originated from North America and the northernmost agricultural regions of Russia (Figure S2). Similar behavior has also been found for the two other polar sites, where higher numbers of pesticides were encountered in the samples, where air masses were influenced by Scandinavia and the British Isles (Figures S3 and S4). The origins of free tropospheric air collected at mountain sites were all from continental Europe (Figure S5).
Previous observations of more than 20 currently used pesticides in the polar regions in recent years have highlighted the LRAT potential of currently used pesticides (10,22−24) (Table S10). However, these studies have mainly focused on a limited number of currently used pesticides. In this study, 19 pesticides were found to be associated with LRAT at the polar sites. Out of these, four substances, atrazine, chlorpyrifos, pendimethalin, and triallate, had previously been reported in polar regions, whereas we are establishing the first evidence of LRAT for 15 pesticides that have previously not been encountered in these regions (Figure 3). Three of these substances, atrazine, chlorpyrifos, and diuron, are water policy-prioritized in the EU. The potential risk for the environment and human health is also evidenced by the fact that among the pesticides identified as prone to LRAT, 2 are carcinogens, 6 are genotoxic, 10 are endocrine disruptors, and 9 are reprotoxic. (10,57) In addition, the 22 long-range transported pesticides belong to 16 different chemical classes (57) and their physicochemical properties range widely, i.e., saturation vapor pressure ranging from 9.2 × 10–9 to 0.67 Pa with log KOW from 1.55 to 6.52 (Table S11), with chlorpyrifos, fenpropidin, fenpropimorph, pendimethalin, S-metolachlor, and spiroxamine potentially (logKow > 5) known to be bioaccumulative. (19)
There was a considerable shift of the pesticides’ gas/particle partitioning from the continent to the Arctic, with a higher gaseous fraction for 14 out of 15 pesticides observed at the polar sites than at midlatitude sites. This trend was most prominent for terbuthylazine, which was on average 99% in the particulate phase at rural sites but >98% in the gaseous phase at polar sites. The exception was triallate, which at one polar site was quantified in the particulate phase only (>87%, Table S12). Our observations suggest that pesticides which are predominantly partitioning to the particulate phase in aerosols over Europe tend to be found in the gaseous phase in the Arctic (Figure 2). This pattern is consistent with previous studies, with pesticides such as 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile, chloroneb, dicofol, nitrapyrin, and triallate observed only in the gas phase of Arctic air (22,24) (Table S10), while in in this study, pesticides in continental Europe preferentially partitioned to the particulate phase, as suggested by the results from mountains and rural sites where the gas phase was also collected. (15)
A preference for partitioning to the gas phase at polar sites can be explained by low aerosol mass and surface concentrations and the prevalence of hydrophilic particulate matter (PM) components in particular seasalt. (58) For example, at the central European rural site KOS (Czech Republic), the concentration of PM10 was 12.8 μg m–3 on average during the study, while 4.3 μg m–3 was measured at the polar site ZPO, Svalbard. (59) Organic matter is a key constituent influencing the partitioning of chemicals onto PM. (60) In continental Europe, the fraction of organic matter in PM is generally higher than that in the Arctic. At the rural sites adjacent to agriculture, the particulate organic carbon averaged 1.53 μg m–3 (≈12%), whereas at polar sites, it was more than 10-fold lower, 0.11 μg m–3 (≈3%) on average. No in-depth analysis of gas/particle partitioning is possible because of the lack of particulate phase chemical composition data for most of the sites. Another possible explanation could be volatilization of CUPs from melting snow, mixed into sample air shortly before collection, i.e., before complete relaxation to phase equilibrium. Volatilization from melting snow is expected for organic substances, which within snowpacks would partition significantly to the pore space, (61) however, this does not apply for the CUPs, which partitioning apparently shifted to the gas phase (Table S12).
The three polar sites included in this study had similar environmental conditions (temperature, PM concentration) but are distanced from each other by >1000 km and were influenced by different air masses (Figures S1–S5). Still, out of the 19 pesticides encountered at these sites, five were observed at more than one polar site, which provides independent evidence of long-range atmospheric transport. Moreover, we quantified 13 pesticides in free tropospheric air collected at three high mountain sites, indicating that they are prone to LRAT. 11 pesticides identified at those mountain sites were also identified at polar sites, thus providing strong evidence of their LRAT potential.
Current Limitations Regarding Pesticide Environmental Risk Assessments
Pesticide authorization in Europe presupposes environmental risk assessment with criteria for persistence, bioaccumulation potential, long-range transport potential, and toxicity for soil and water. However, there is no threshold value to consider a pesticide as persistent in the atmosphere. (27) The only parameter through which the atmosphere is included in the risk assessment procedure is the potential for long-range atmospheric transport. To assess this potential, the atmospheric half-life is used as a proxy. For this, only the reactivity with the OH radical in the gas phase is considered, using global and annual mean OH radical concentrations. (62) A pesticide exhibiting a half-life higher than 2 days is considered as prone to LRAT.
However, all 22 pesticides identified as prone to LRAT in this study have been estimated to have atmospheric half-lives shorter than 2 days based on the model currently used in the risk assessment (36) (Table S11). But OH concentrations can be much lower seasonally, at high latitudes, as well as during nighttime or in the polar night. (63) In these cases, degradation processes are substantially reduced, with correspondingly longer effective atmospheric half-lives and travel distances. (24) For instance, the atmospheric and total environmental lifetimes of atrazine are almost 1 order of magnitude longer for midlatitude winter than in summer (64) and the characteristic travel distance (CTD) of chlorpyrifos increases from 30 to 290 km with a 10-fold reduced OH concentration. (52) CTD is an indicator of a chemical’s long-range transport potential in a generic multicompartment environment under steady-state conditions and is influenced by also lifetime in soil and water. (52,65) It is defined as the distance from the source region at which the concentration is reduced by 63%. (66) Note that because of the generic nature of the underlying multimedia model, CTD is not suitable to test substance fate or should not be interpreted in absolute terms (km). CTDs of the targeted pesticides are estimated mostly below 100 km (median is 92 km) and are estimated even somewhat lower with a median of 68 km for the substances identified as prone to LRAT, suggesting that these chemicals are unlikely to reach remote locations. The CTD values or their ranking do not correspond with substances suggested from this or earlier studies to have high long-range transport potential, with only one exception, i.e., thiacloprid (Figure S14 and Table S11).
Moreover, for pesticides transported in the particulate phase, degradation is expected to be slower than in the gas phase due to diffusion limitation in low-viscosity aerosol particles. (33,67) Experiments on degradation rate coefficients with OH in the particulate phase suggest atmospheric half-lives of weeks (given global mean OH radical concentration). (33,34) Oxidation is particularly slow in aerosols transported at high altitudes or to high latitudes and expectedly most relevant for moderately polar pesticides such as carbamates, triazines, thiophosphoric acid esters, phenols, and anilines. (34,67) As confirmed in this study, pesticides tend to have higher particle-bound mass fractions in continental air than in polar air, and their persistence in air is therefore likely underestimated. This aspect is neglected by the current risk assessment practice.
Furthermore, the effective atmospheric lifetime of semivolatiles resisting degradation in soils and surface water can be much longer than the residence time in air based on degradation kinetics because of several cycles of revolatilization and deposition enhancing the LRAT potential (multihopping). (28)
In addition to the lack of information about active ingredients, the influence of application methods, formulants, and adjuvants on CUP emissions is not well known. While aerial application is banned in Europe, spraying of soil and plant, (12) volatilization, (68,69) and also pellet application to soil and seed treatment contribute to pesticide emissions. (70) Formulants and adjuvants are used to improve the effectiveness of application but can modify their effective vapor pressure and atmospheric half-lives. (71) A recent experimental study suggested that the reactivity of the chlorpyrifos with OH radicals was different in a commercial formulation than that of the substance alone. (35)
This study shows the limits of the risk assessment in place in the regulatory process on the atmospheric fate of pesticides and, in particular, their potential for LRAT, by providing empirical evidence in direct contrast to current model predictions. There is a real need to revise the current methods used for environmentally relevant conditions (different temperature and/or OH concentrations) as well as to obtain more experimental data on atmospheric degradability of pesticides including pesticide formulations and preparations, in addition to data from monitoring studies. Currently, the framework does not consider partitioning into the particulate phase or slowed degradation in soil/water during the multihopping. More realistic modeling is extremely important if we want to ensure that the pesticides authorized for agricultural use in Europe (and elsewhere) do not contaminate the environment and pose health risks hundreds of thousands of kilometers away from the source areas.

,,"For B. terrestris and B. impatiens, exposure to neonicotinoids reduced hibernation success (53) and egg laying (17) and delayed colony initiation (15, 207), indicating the potential for population-level consequences. Additionally, reductions in the production of reproductive offspring (gynes and males)—an important metric for bumble bee population persistence—have been related to exposure to neonicotinoids and other insecticides through field-realistically contaminated food (119, 157, 197), to neonicotinoids through agricultural use (142, 203, 205), and to pesticide mixtures created by bees foraging within a landscape (126, 145)—the latter expanding to another species, Bombus vosnesenskii. There are also indications that pesticide mixtures, in this case, the combination of neonicotinoids and pyrethroids, could contribute to colony failure (65), with possible population-level consequences. However, there are also examples from similar field or field-realistic studies of other pesticides, such as other neonicotinoids, being compatible with maintained offspring production (95, 143)—again highlighting the importance of exposure level and pesticide product.

Reproduction effects observed after neonicotinoid exposure under laboratory or semi-field conditions might not necessarily be observed under field conditions (156); this lack of transferability of outcomes from controlled to natural conditions partly relates to colony and population recovery processes. Once affected by pesticides, populations of mobile organisms could recover through demographic or recolonization recovery (see 141). Demographic recovery can occur through increased fitness due to more resources or reduced resource competition or through individuals or life stages that escape or are resistant to exposure, which in bees could include egg or pupal life stages and be influenced by context, such as flower resource availability (172) and traits such as generation time, life span, and voltinism (see 141). Sociality might be a trait that influences demographic recovery, allowing loss of part of the workforce without losing their reproductive potential, a buffer lacking in solitary species (33, 42, 60, 169). Such social buffering could be one factor explaining why O. bicornis nesting and B. terrestris colony growth and gyne production were negatively affected by Elado (a mixture of the neonicotinoid clothianidin and the pyrethroid β-cyfluthrin) seed treatment in spring-sown oilseed rape, while A. mellifera colony growth was not measurably affected (142).

Recolonization recovery (see 141) can occur in complex landscapes made up of mosaics of land covers and land uses that are more or less suitable habitat (24) and where bees may be more or less exposed to pesticides (139). This type of recovery has been suggested to occur in bees through the buffering capacity of (semi)natural areas (129). If pesticide exposure causes population reduction on a local scale, then the population size may be restored by dispersal from nearby source habitats such as semi-natural, less disturbed areas (129). However, if local populations are repeatedly extinguished in one (sink) area, and recolonization occurs by immigration of individuals from source habitats, then the sink could reduce the overall population, eventually leading to landscape-scale extinction (see 185). The potential for recolonization recovery has been suggested to be influenced by traits such as dispersal ability and territorial behavior, with less mobile species, such as solitary compared to (eu)social bee species (88), and species with a fixed territory, such as bees during their nesting phase, having a higher risk of local extinction from pesticides (see 141). Despite the importance of recovery processes in maintaining long-term population persistence, there have been limited research efforts in this direction for non-Apis bees, likely due to the logistical and resource limitations of landscape-level field studies. Pollinator population models could provide an opportunity to combine data from (more limited) field studies and expert knowledge to better understand complex ecological processes over sufficient space and time (62, 75).

In addition to acting as dispersal sources, semi-natural areas could provide added flower resources in either overgrown and abandoned or intensified production landscapes. Evidence is building that access to abundant and diverse floral resources can reduce pesticide exposure and thereby mitigate fitness effects, or even reduce effects under maintained exposure, in cages (82, 93, 172, 204) and in agricultural landscapes (145). Combining findings on the reproduction effects of imidacloprid exposure and floral resources for O. lignaria in cages with those of flower resource levels in intensively managed agricultural landscapes indicated that population persistence is only likely under conditions of low pesticide exposure and high flower resource availability (173) ( Figure 3 ). Above, we discuss mostly the direct effects that pesticides might have on bee populations. However, pesticide, and more specifically herbicide, use may not necessarily affect bees directly; instead, it most likely affects bees indirectly by reducing the availability and extent of floral resources (26). Farmland management advice can include the removal of non-crop flowering plants before pesticide application to reduce exposure; however, this likely is counterproductive and contributes to, rather than prevents, bee decline (124). Even if both pesticide-treated crop and contaminated non-crop flowers expose bees to pesticides, the flowers can provide a net reproductive benefit (95, 143, 145).

3.4.   Effects on Communities and Ecosystem Functions Are Poorly Understood and Used
Understanding how pesticide exposure might affect the structure and dynamics of wild pollinator communities and the critical ecosystem (pollination) services that they provide to crops and wild plant communities is essential. Currently, there is limited knowledge of pesticide impacts on the diversity of non-Apis bees and their pollination services and of how to incorporate management of such species to facilitate ecosystem service delivery, given our current reliance on pesticides in crop production.

Agricultural intensification, including increases in the use of insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides, has led to substantial negative impacts on wild plant and beneficial insect biodiversity and calls within the European Union for a Europe-wide shift toward farming with minimal use of pesticides over large areas (63). However, while reductions in pesticide exposure associated with organic practices can have beneficial impacts for non-Apis bees (e.g., 81, 144) and the pollination services that they provide (e.g., 4), these effects are not ubiquitous (e.g., 31).

Long-term UK occupancy data suggest that wild bee species documented to forage from oilseed rape were substantially less likely to persist in a specific location due to the negative impacts of neonicotinoid exposure (206). Persistent neonicotinoid contamination of soils in crop fields and margins has been associated with reduced native bee species richness (114, 115), supporting the emerging view that soils remain an understudied route of exposure and potential risk for non-Apis bees. Declines in wild bee abundance and species richness were also correlated with increasing pesticide use in New York state apple orchards one year after application (129). These negative effects of pesticide exposure on wild bees appear to be driven primarily by fungicide applications before apple bloom, despite the fact that fungicides are often considered relatively safe for bees (129, 140). These deleterious impacts of pesticide exposure for wild bee biodiversity were at least partially buffered by greater amounts of natural habitat in the landscape surrounding apple orchards (129).

Bumble bee (B. terrestris) colonies exposed to thiamethoxam visited flowers less frequently and collected pollen less often from apple trees in a cage study (163). Importantly, the foraging activities of these pesticide-exposed bees contributed to the production of apples containing fewer seeds, indicating reduced delivery of pollination services. Changes in pollination service provision to this crop can likely be explained by pesticide-exposure impacts at the colony, rather than the individual behavioral, level. Bombus terrestris colonies exposed to either the pesticide product Closer (containing sulfoxaflor) or Amistar (containing azoxystrobin) sprayed directly onto Phacelia tanacetifolia plants showed impaired foraging performance in a cage study (176), and bees exposed to Amistar deposited fewer pollen grains on Phacelia flowers than untreated controls. Bombus impatiens colonies exposed to a mixture of imidacloprid (neonicotinoid soil drench) and lambda-cyhalothrin (pyrethroid foliar spray) delivered substantially reduced pollination services to watermelon (32% reduction in fruit set) in a cage study (82). Bumble bee colony survival was dramatically reduced in insecticide-treated cages without supplemental clover, suggesting that supplemental forage can ameliorate the negative impacts of insecticide exposure for crop-pollinating bees. Osmia bicornis foraging on clothianidin-treated oilseed rape showed impaired performance as pollinators of strawberries, with berries weighing approximately 10% less in neonicotinoid-treated cages (79). Exposure to a fungal biopesticide (Metarhizium anisopliae, developed by ICIPE) applied as a spray had no measurable effects on mortality, foraging behavior, or pollination service provision by the African stingless bee (Meliponula ferruginea) to a greenhouse cucumber crop (127).

 
4.  PESTICIDE INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER STRESSORS
 
Currently, bees are simultaneously dealing with multiple, potentially interacting, environmental stressors. Pesticide exposure combined with other stressors, e.g., parasites, nutritional stress, and climate change, can affect bee mortality, reproduction, behavior, and immune response antagonistically, additively, or synergistically. While most research to date has focused on honey bees, increasing evidence is emerging from non-Apis bee studies.

Combined pesticide and pathogen exposure can sometimes, but not always, increase the severity of impacts on important endpoints for bumble bees (e.g., queen mortality, queen production, or worker learning performance) compared to the effects of either stressor alone. For example, foundress queens in bumble bee colonies exposed to neonicotinoids (clothianidin and thiamethoxam) and a trypanosome pathogen (Crithidia bombi) had reduced survival compared to those in colonies challenged by either stressor individually (54). However, while both neonicotinoid exposure or trypanosome infection reduced B. terrestris queen hibernation survival, there was no measurable additional or synergistic effect of combined exposure (53). Similarly, B. terrestris colonies exposed to lambda-cyhalothrin were not measurably more susceptible to trypanosome infections (16). Although B. terrestris workers infected by the microsporidian parasite Nosema ceranae were slower than uninfected controls to learn odor–reward associations, the learning performance of workers both exposed to clothianidin and infected by N. ceranae was measurably faster (134). Bombus terrestris colony performance is also impaired by exposure to different pesticides (neonicotinoids, pyrethroids, or EBI fungicides) combined with N. ceranae infection (29). Workers exposed to both the pyrethroid and fungicide had lower incidence of N. ceranae infection, perhaps because the fungal pathogen is impacted by the fungicide, and colonies exposed to thiamethoxam (singly or in combination) produced 40–76% fewer new queens (29).

Laboratory microcolony studies suggest that B. impatiens workers are highly tolerant to Nosema bombi infection, which was not significantly mitigated by chlorothalonil exposure, but workers both exposed to fungicide and infected with N. bombi carried more transmission-ready microsporidian spores (35). The prevalence of N. bombi infections appeared higher in some declining bumble bee compared to common bumble bee species in the United States (36), and greater total fungicide use was the best predictor of both N. bombi prevalence at a landscape scale and range contractions for declining Bombus species (118).

Both poor nutrition and pesticide exposure can have negative impacts on bees, which may be exacerbated by these factors occurring together. Although the effects of nutritionally poorer (monofloral) pollen diets were broadly overshadowed by impacts of imidacloprid exposure for B. impatiens queens (106), we know that restricted pollen diets can impact larval development (178). For example, Osmia cornifrons collected a more Rosaceae-dominated diet when foraging in more agriculturally dominated landscapes, which led to increased fungicide-related risk and reduced female offspring weight (38). The impacts of sulfoxaflor exposure on B. terrestris workers in microcolonies can be exacerbated in the presence of a sucrose-deficient diet that induces greater physiological stress and increases the amount of pesticide consumed (109). This nutritional stress either additively or synergistically exacerbated the negative effects of sulfoxaflor exposure on worker survival, egg laying, and larval production. Results from a semi-field cage study revealed strong additive effects of combined exposure to imidacloprid (soil drench) and low density of floral resources on O. lignaria reproduction (172), with combined pesticide exposure and food limitation reducing solitary bee reproduction by 57% ( Figure 3 ).

The distribution and diversity of flowers in a landscape affect the nutritional quality of bee diets, and providing additional floral resources in agricultural landscapes could improve diet quality; it could also either create further potential routes for pesticide exposure (27, 168, 196) or serve as a method to mitigate risks of such exposure (82, 93, 145). Flower plantings in Californian agricultural field margins supported greater reproduction by both O. lignaria and B. vosnesenskii (145). Perhaps unsurprisingly given their likely relative foraging ranges, O. lignaria was more heavily reliant on additional local flower plantings, while floral resources at the landscape level were more important for B. vosnesenskii. Bumble bee colony reproduction was impaired by high levels of pesticide exposure, but this effect was ameliorated by flower plantings (145).

Very few studies have considered pesticide and temperature interactions for non-Apis bees. Bombus terrestris workers orally exposed to imidacloprid showed a temperature-dependent decrease in distance flown at 30°C, compared to untreated controls, that was not seen at the lower temperatures tested (90). No measurable impacts of sulfoxaflor exposure on flight performance were reported at any of the temperatures tested.

 
5.  POLICY IMPLICATIONS, GAPS, AND FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
 
Pesticides make up one of the best-regulated groups of chemicals; before these products reach the market, they undergo ERAs, with bees being one of the non-target organisms assessed (158, 162). In several regions of the world, including Australia, Brazil, Europe, and North America, the pesticide ERA is a tiered approach in which mainly single-use pesticides are evaluated individually for exposure and effects in increasingly complicated, specific, and costly tiers (105, 130, 162). If concerns are triggered in the presumably more conservative and controlled lower tiers, then tests and assessments are moved to more environmentally realistic and specific higher tiers, all in relation to shared protection goals (25). These protection goals can be very broad and relate to general protection of biodiversity or formulated into more specific and operational protection goals (158). Such specific protection goals could be a reduction of a certain magnitude in the colony size of social bees or the population size of solitary bees (49). However, the definition and implementation of such protection goals are hindered by the limitations of our current knowledge and understanding of, as well as methods to track, exposure and impacts of pesticides for non-Apis bees.

Both scientifically and in an ERA context, there are many potential gaps that could be addressed. Can taxonomic variation in pesticide sensitivity be accounted for with the use of safety factors in conjunction with honey bee toxicity data in ERAs, or are more tests on additional model species required? How can we scale from sublethal effects of pesticide exposure to individuals (and/or colonies where applicable) to population-level impacts? How do we make these connections between levels of organization and relevant spatiotemporal scales? How well do we know the relative importance of the pesticide stressor in relation to other stressors or factors for long-term bee population persistence? Answering these questions will require us to explore bees’ intrinsic sensitivity, capture landscape dynamics (e.g., source–sink dynamics, internal and external recovery processes), and better understand pesticides in relation to other stressors that impact bee taxa in different ways according to their lifestyles.

5.1.   Representativeness for the Bee Community
The honey bee is used as an ERA model species under the assumption that findings related to exposure and effects for these bees can be extended to cover other bee taxa (60, 158), although the European Union has expanded their guidance on ERAs to include Bombus and Osmia (48). Discussions are ongoing about the need to diversify model species, with potential candidates including the handful of commercially available or managed bumble, solitary, and stingless bee species (30, 59, 69, 111, 153). In an ERA context, expansion to other species could be motivated by the desire to include exposure pathways that are not relevant to honey bees but could be relevant to the majority of other non-Apis species, e.g., pesticide residues in soil (58, 139, 199, 201), or model species that are more appropriate for determining and linking sublethal and population-level impacts under field conditions and in higher tiers (30, 34, 60, 104, 142). However, these potential candidates may not represent common traits of the bee community. For example, all except one of the commercially available solitary bee species are above-ground cavity nesters (Megachile or Osmia spp.), with the exception being the ground nester Nomia melanderi (153). Other suggestions for model species include the European O. brevicornis (78) and the North American E. pruinosa (201). From a scientific point of view, it is problematic that our understanding is limited to so few bee species and mostly to neonicotinoid insecticides (46), meaning that extrapolation to bees and pesticides in general is not yet possible. Therefore, expanding our methods and understanding beyond this limited set of species and insecticides should be a research priority. The taxonomic expansion could depart from the species vulnerability approach, in which species are vulnerable due to a combination of high exposure, intrinsic sensitivity, and little ability to recover (191). This approach has been used on a set of 10 bee species in an ERA context, and the conclusion was that the non-Apis species assessed were probably more vulnerable than honey bees, particularly in terms of exposure and ability to recover (149).

5.2.   Exposure Pathways
Given the diversity of bee species and lifestyles and how little we know about bees’ pesticide exposure, defining exposure pathways and scenarios for non-Apis bees that differ in their trait profiles represents an important area for further research. This could be explored, for example, using exposome or aggregate exposure pathway approaches; the former defines the lifetime environmental exposure, accounting for lifestyle variability (52), and the latter follows pesticides from the source of release, through the exposure medium, external exposure, and internal exposure, to targets of exposure inside the organism (179). Such approaches have yet to be applied to non-Apis bees.

5.3.   Effect Extrapolation
Linking exposure to effects, both direct and indirect, as well as linking sub-individual or individual impacts to population or community effects and further to interspecific interactions, is another challenge. A potentially useful approach could be the use of adverse outcome pathways (5), which have been applied to B. impatiens and B. terrestris for neonicotinoids (37), or toxicokinetic–toxicodynamic modeling, which has so far only been applied to honey bees (12). Different modeling approaches have also been suggested for extrapolating across biological levels of organization and dealing with the protection of populations from exposure to multiple pesticides and other stressors (e.g., 12, 13, 15, 33, 92, 136, 187). However, the application to non-Apis bees has been limited, with a few exceptions that simulate how pesticides affect the development of bumble bee colonies (14, 19) or bee populations (94) in more or less realistic landscapes.

Combining modeling with experimental studies is likely the only feasible way to account for both direct and indirect effects of pesticides on non-target organisms, both scientifically and in an ERA context (107). It is of critical importance to understand if and how pesticide use may put bees at risk; the answers to these questions have consequences for the long-term survival of bees and the pollination services they provide. From a global perspective, and in light of bee species richness and pesticide use patterns ( Figure 1 ), it would be particularly valuable to focus such studies on South America and other regions where bees and pesticides intersect heavily.

Finally, to more holistically tackle the possible role of pesticide use in the decline of bees and other insects, along with the other factors that may have positive or negative effects on them, there is a need to look beyond ERAs of pesticides and to integrate regulations, strategies, and policies that often separately deal with threats to and support of bees (50). This would require removing regulatory silos to allow bee conservation to happen in concert with the regulatory and related processes of risk removal and pesticide use mitigation, for example, through access to abundant and diverse flower resources (82, 93, 145, 172, 204) and landscape-level access to semi-natural areas (96, 129, 139). This should help inform risk management options—such as where and when to provide additional floral plantings or allow pesticide use—and could form a component in integrated pollinator and pest management (22, 112) to remove or mitigate pesticide risks for non-target beneficial insects and simultaneously sustain and enhance pollination services to crop and non-crop plants.

,,"ABSTRACT
 
Bees are essential pollinators of many crops and wild plants, and pesticide exposure is one of the key environmental stressors affecting their health in anthropogenically modified landscapes. Until recently, almost all information on routes and impacts of pesticide exposure came from honey bees, at least partially because they were the only model species required for environmental risk assessments (ERAs) for insect pollinators. Recently, there has been a surge in research activity focusing on pesticide exposure and effects for non-Apis bees, including other social bees (bumble bees and stingless bees) and solitary bees. These taxa vary substantially from honey bees and one another in several important ecological traits, including spatial and temporal activity patterns, foraging and nesting requirements, and degree of sociality. In this article, we review the current evidence base about pesticide exposure pathways and the consequences of exposure for non-Apis bees. We find that the insights into non-Apis bee pesticide exposure and resulting impacts across biological organizations, landscapes, mixtures, and multiple stressors are still in their infancy. The good news is that there are many promising approaches that could be used to advance our understanding, with priority given to informing exposure pathways, extrapolating effects, and determining how well our current insights (limited to very few species and mostly neonicotinoid insecticides under unrealistic conditions) can be generalized to the diversity of species and lifestyles in the global bee community. We conclude that future research to expand our knowledge would also be beneficial for ERAs and wider policy decisions concerning pollinator conservation and pesticide regulation.

1.  INTRODUCTION
 
Under the looming shadow of a sixth mass extinction of species (41), with mounting evidence of declines in terrestrial arthropods (73, 152, 190, 194, 195), there is an urgent need to understand the unintended impacts of pesticide use for non-target arthropods. Despite substantial research and policy focus on this issue for bees over the past two decades, much of our understanding of the routes and impacts of pesticide exposure has come from honey bees (Apis mellifera) (186). This is primarily driven by their use as an insect pollinator model species for regulatory pesticide risk assessments, motivated by their convenience for ecotoxicological testing (30, 60, 69) and interests in bee products and crop pollination. However, honey bee ecology and life history are atypical for bees. In contrast, the majority of the approximately 20,000 bee species worldwide do not live in perennial, social colonies in cavities, but are instead solitary, and many species spend most of their life developing and living in soil (44).

The honey bee may be no more or less sensitive to the direct effects of pesticides than other bees or even insects more generally (9, 74). However, when considering bees in their ecological or (non)social context, there is an emerging understanding that honey bees may not represent pesticide use consequences for the vast majority of solitary bee species (44); the approximately 250 bumble bee species that are social for only part of their life cycle (61); or the approximately 600 stingless bee species that, like honey bees, live in perennial, social colonies (71). Recent years have seen increased focus on routes and impacts of pesticide exposure for these non-Apis bee species, even if most studies are focused on a limited set of species that can be kept in captivity and on the impacts of neonicotinoid insecticides (42, 159).

In this review, we shine a light on the current understanding of pesticide exposure and its effects for non-Apis bees, singly and in combination with other environmental stressors, from individual to population and ecosystem consequences, and from the laboratory to the field. We approach bee diversity and consequences of pesticide use through a lens of ecological traits, since such traits are anticipated to modify the bees’ pesticide exposure and subsequent impacts. These traits include the seasonal phenology of their activity (flight) period during the year, diurnal activity patterns, floral preferences (lecty), nesting ecology (including construction materials and location), degree of sociality, individual or colony longevity, foraging range, and mobility in the landscape (32, 87, 153, 180, 188, 202). Furthermore, we consider pesticide effects combined with other environmental stressors, including land-use intensification (and related habitat loss and fragmentation); climate change; and the spread of alien species, pathogens, and diseases (103, 135, 192). We end by highlighting important areas of future research and reflecting on the environmental risk assessment (ERA) of pesticides and the wider policy context relevant to bee conservation and pesticide regulation.

 
2.  PESTICIDE EXPOSURE
 
Pesticide exposure pathways emerge from the spatiotemporal intersection between bee activity patterns and pesticide contamination of the landscape—the latter resulting from pesticide use and fate [conceptualized by Sponsler et al. (162)]. It is therefore essential to understand both spatial and temporal patterns of pesticide use, accounting for distribution and degradation, as well as where bees occupy the landscape, i.e., their habitat use, over their life cycle and how they use and come into contact with different materials to understand bee pesticide exposure. On a global scale, high bee species richness (128) and greater pesticide use on cropland (177) co-occur in South and North America and the Mediterranean regions ( Figure 1 ). Such spatial co-occurrence could indicate the potential for substantial pesticide exposure for a significant part of these bee communities. Bees can be exposed to pesticides throughout their life cycle—during foraging, nest construction, brood care, and hibernation and through either oral (nectar, pollen, water, or honeydew) or contact (air, plants, propolis or resin, wax, or soil) exposure—with exposure being species and life stage dependent (30). We illustrate these different pesticide exposure pathways among bees and influences of nesting and foraging habits in Figure 2 ."

Background
Pesticide exposure has been linked to some autoimmune diseases and colorectal cancer, possibly via alteration of gut microbiota or other mechanisms. While pesticides have been linked to gut dysbiosis and inflammation in animal models, few epidemiologic studies have examined pesticides in relation to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

We evaluated use of pesticides and incident IBD in 68,480 eligible pesticide applicators and spouses enrolled in the Agricultural Health Study.

Methods
Self-reported IBD cases were identified from follow-up questionnaires between enrollment (1993–1997) and 2022. We evaluated IBD incidence in relation to self-reported ever use of 50 pesticides among applicators and spouses. We also explored associations with intensity-weighted lifetime days (IWLD) of pesticide use among male applicators. Covariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Cox regression.

Results
We identified 454 IBD cases, including 227 among male applicators. In analyses with applicators and spouses combined, associations were positive (HR > 1.2) for ever vs. never use of five organochlorine insecticides, three organophosphate insecticides, one fungicide, and five herbicides. HRs were highest for dieldrin (HR = 1.59, 95%CI: 1.03, 2.44), toxaphene (HR = 1.61, 95%CI: 1.17, 2.21), parathion (HR = 1.42, 95%CI: 1.03, 1.95), and terbufos (HR = 1.53, 95%CI: 1.19, 1.96). We had limited power in many IWLD of pesticide use analyses and did not find clear evidence of exposure-response trends; however, we observed elevated HRs in all tertiles of IWLD use of terbufos compared to never use (T1 vs. never use HR = 1.52, 95%CI: 1.03, 2.24; T2 vs. never use HR = 1.53, 95%CI: 1.04, 2.26; T3 vs. never use HR = 1.51, 95%CI: 1.03, 2.23).

Conclusions
Exposure to specific pesticides was associated with elevated hazards of IBD. These findings may have public health importance given the widespread use of pesticides and the limited number of known modifiable environmental risk factors for IBD.

Abstract
 
Residues of pesticides on crops can result in mortality to foraging bees. Pesticide applicators in the U.S. encounter a statement on pesticide labels, which coarsely indicate which products dissipate over the course of an evening. There is reason to suspect that these statements may not align with residual toxicity data, given previous findings. Without a complete database of residual toxicity estimates; however, it is not possible to determine whether the residual toxicity components of statements on pesticide labels similarly diverge from published studies. We compiled 50 studies on residual toxicity trials with formulated pesticides and calculated the residual time to 25% mortality (RT25) of each assay for three different bee species (Apis mellifera, Nomia melanderi, and Megachile rotundata). Our findings were compared to a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published database of RT25 values. Of the RT25 values that we could compare, we found that over 90% of the values support a similar conclusion to the EPA. Next, we compared our values and the EPA’s values to the statements on 155 EPA registered pesticide product labels. Of these labels, a little less than a third presented their residual toxicity in a manner inconsistent with their calculated RT25 and current EPA labeling guidelines. Moreover, over a third of labels contained an active ingredient which was neither listed under the EPA’s RT25 database nor had a published study to estimate this value. We provide the first evidence that many pesticide labels may convey residual toxicity information to applicators that is not correct and could lead to bees being exposed to toxic residues on plants.

Main article text
 
Introduction
Pesticides can have negative impacts on individual bees and bee colonies when toxic products are applied to blooming plants that are bee attractive (Botías et al., 2017; Chauzat et al., 2010; Kiljanek et al., 2017; Tosi et al., 2018; Graham et al., 2021). Bees can become exposed to pesticide residues when foraging on pesticide-treated plants, which can result in mortality if the residues are at levels that are acutely toxic to them. Mortality, however, may be lessened if the pesticide is applied in the evening, when bees are not foraging. Theoretically, this allows for an interval over which the pesticide can dissipate on the plant sufficiently to become relatively non-toxic to bees when they resume foraging the next day (Johansen et al., 1983a; Johansen et al., 1983b). Evening pesticide applications as a way to mitigate exposure, however, are predicated on the assumption that the residues of the pesticides will weather sufficiently before bees resume foraging the next morning and come into contact with treated leaves and flowers (Barmaz, Potts & Vighi, 2010; Fischer & Moriarty, 2011; The Honey Bee Health Coalition, 2019; Smodiš Škerl et al., 2009).

The rate at which acute toxicity of pesticides to bees dissipates from plant surfaces is known as the pesticide’s residual time. Pesticide registrants in the U.S. are required to estimate the residual time for all formulated pesticides that contain one or more active ingredients that is acutely toxic to bees (i.e., acute contact toxicity lethal dose to 50% of the honey bees (LD50) is less than 11 micrograms of pesticide per bee) and the use pattern indicates that bees are likely to be exposed (40 CFR 158.630(d)). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides guidance for registrants on how to conduct a trial to estimate residual time (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2012a). These trials involve spraying a field crop (typically alfalfa) with a pesticide, allowing residues to weather for set intervals, then harvesting plant material and placing it in a cage with honey bees (Apis mellifera). The bees are free to walk over the plant material for a set period of time (typically 24 h), after which the number of dead bees is counted. Residual time is expressed as the weathering interval after which the mortality of bees contacting the foliage reaches 25% mortality (referred to as the residual time to 25% mortality or RT25). The basic pattern of these trials pre-dates EPA guidelines and have been used by toxicologists since the 1960s (e.g., Wiese, 1962). Notably, this approach does not take into account the time taken for a systemic pesticide to no longer be present in nectar and pollen, which is addressed elsewhere in the EPA’s risk assessment for bees (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2016)

A key threshold residual time identified by the EPA is known as extended residual toxicity. A pesticide with extended residual toxicity is one that cannot be applied safely in the evening as residues would cause more than 25% mortality of bees in a cage assay. Although the residual time threshold is not specified in the EPA’s Label Review Manual (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2012b); elsewhere, the EPA indicates that a pesticide with extended residual toxicity has RT25 >8 h (Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, 2012). Typically, pesticide labels in the U.S. only indicate whether pesticides that are acutely toxic to bees have extended residual toxicity or not and generally do not list RT25 values (Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, 2012).

RT25 is an important tool in determining how to best mitigate the risk of bee exposure to pesticides residues. The importance of RT25 estimates for pesticide applicators when selecting and applying a pesticide is evinced by state Cooperative Extension publications that list RT25 values from published studies (e.g., Hooven, Sagili & Johansen, 2013). Furthermore, RT25 estimates are used by the EPA in order to characterize the hazards and risks of pesticides to pollinating insects. The EPA requires that a product’s residual toxicity to bees be communicated on the product label in a way that is reflective of the RT25 value. The EPA has produced guidance for their reviewers and pesticide registrants on the language they will typically suggest for different RT25 values (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2012b). This information will typically be available in the Environmental Hazards section of the label, but it is not federally enforceable and is used as an informational tool for pesticide applicators (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2012b). However, pesticide labels rarely state the RT25 value, so this information is not readily accessible to pesticide applicators, crop advisors or extension educators. There remains a demand for better guidance on the dissipation rates of bee toxic products under field conditions.

Notably, more recent EPA guidance (United States Protection Agency, 2017) provides more specific mitigation language around the extended residual toxicity threshold for the safe application of pesticides during bee pollination. These new guidelines provide federally enforceable specific use instructions for residual toxicity stating that if extended residual toxicity (residues persisting for greater than 8 h i.e., extended residual toxicity) is not present for a pesticide it can be applied 2 h before sunset when pollinators are least active (United States Protection Agency, 2017). Pesticide registrants have begun adopting this guidance, one example is Harvanta 50SL (Summit Agro™, Durham, NC, EPA registration number 71512-26-88783), which states for fruiting vegetables (Crop Group 8-10) “foliar application of this product is prohibited to a crop from onset of flowering until flowering is complete unless the application is being made in the time period between 2 h prior to sunset until sunrise”. While this shows that some labels have been written in accordance with this new policy, many pesticide labels still follow pre-2017 guidance in communicating residual toxicity to bees (e.g., Product Dursban 50W, EPA Registration Number 62719-72; Product Merit 2F, EPA Registration Number 432-1312, which states: “do not apply this product or allow it to drift to blooming crops or weeds if bees are visiting the treatment area”). In addition to the 2017 guidance, the EPA released a public summary of RT25 estimates compiled from registrant-submitted data to the public (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2014). Notably, the summary only included studies that have “undergone quality assurance reviews to ensure that the data are scientifically sound”, and, in turn, is missing several widely used active ingredients (e.g., bifenthrin). Regardless, the omissions pose a challenge to researchers looking to compare pesticide label language on residual toxicity to RT25 values. 

There is a need to investigate pesticide label language against studies that characterize environmental risks. Bucy & Melathopoulos (2020), for example, found that roughly 32% of pesticide labels analyzed had at least one error in the communication of acute toxicity to bees, or the adverse effects caused after a short exposure time to an active ingredient (OCSPP 850.3000). These authors, however, were unable to do a similar analysis with residual toxicity statements because of the absence of a comprehensive database of RT25 values. 

Our objective was to provide the first analysis of pesticide label statements communicating residual toxicity to bees in comparison to actual RT25 values. The overall reason for doing this is to ensure that residual toxicity information is correctly communicated to pesticide applicators on labels. We approached the challenges experienced by Bucy & Melathopoulos (2020) by creating a database of RT25 values to compare to pesticide label statements. Our approach to creating a database was to assemble all published residual toxicity studies and characterize variability in methodologies used to assess residual toxicity. We then conducted a systematic review to calculate RT25 estimates for each pesticide and validated these estimates against values published by EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2014). We used the validated database to analyze the residual toxicity statement on pesticide labels and to determine how RT25 estimates vary by the rate of pesticide used, the formulation of the pesticide, and bee species.

Materials & Methods
Selection of studies
Portions of this manuscript were previously published as part of a preprint (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.05.543089v1.full). We located putative residual toxicity studies using Web of Science with the search term “residual toxicity” as well as the names of bee taxa commonly used in residual toxicity assays and currently listed in EPA’s RT25 database: “Apis”, “Nomia” and “Megachile”. This search returned a total of 130 studies. Next, we located residual toxicity studies on the alfalfa leafcutting bee (Megachile rotundata) from proceedings of the Western Alfalfa Seed Growers Association (2004-2017), resulting in an additional 17 studies. We also evaluated a series of Bee Research Investigation and Integrated Pest and Pollinator Investigation reports released by Washington State University amounting to 28 reports. Finally, we obtained 8 studies directly from Bayer CropSciences. In sum, we evaluated 183 residual toxicity studies. Databases were last searched in 2022. We narrowed these studies down to 50 by only including studies that met any of the following criteria: (1) the study was a primary source of data (e.g., not a review paper); (2) bees were exposed to the pesticide applied to on plant material (e.g., no studies where pesticide was applied to filter paper); and/or, (3) the study focused on residual toxicity of pesticides applied to plots of crop plants and involved harvesting plant tissue for caged bees. These criteria were designed to ensure that we only included studies whose residual toxicity methodology broadly followed those of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (2016). We removed two additional studies because the author indicated that it was likely that some live bees in the assay were mistakenly counted as dead (Johansen, Kious & Mayer, 1981) and because the actual active ingredient of the product used was not specified (Walsh et al., 2011).

Evaluation of studies
This analysis consisted of residual toxicity studies where a pesticide was foliar applied onto a specific crop, and the plant material (e.g., foliage) was harvested at varying time intervals after application. The plant material was then collected and placed in cages with adult bees to contact for 24 h or longer. Residual toxicity was calculated from variation in bee mortality for bees exposed to plant material harvested at different intervals of weathering. We defined each time interval that plant material was collected at as one trial. Although studies were selected based on their broad adherence with the methodology developed by (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2016), they varied across several test parameters. We categorized the variance from EPA methodology across four key study parameters (Table 1)."
,,"We used the following approaches to standardize methodologies across studies. The EPA uses the word “young” to describe the optimal age of bees for residual toxicity trials. We interpreted “young” to mean newly emerged adult (eclosed) bees that were less than 1 day of age (Winston, 1991). Furthermore, when a study reported a range for a parameter, such as for number of bees per cage or temperature, we used the average calculated from the low and high points of the range. In reference to the diet that the bees were fed during the assay, one study reported the syrup concentration as 91:1 (wt:wt) which we assumed was 1:1 (Mayer, 2001).

We evaluated whether parameters in studies aligned with EPA recommendations, by counting each testing parameter as described in ‘Evaluation of studies’. We noted whether studies had test parameters that corresponded to those recommended by the EPA or if there was not enough information to determine correspondence.

Calculation of RT25 values
Very few studies report RT25 values, instead reported the number of bees alive or dead at different time intervals. In order to compare the values in these studies to EPA’s RT25 values we used the mortality data from different time intervals to estimate RT25. Trials within studies were compiled by active ingredient, the formulation of the pesticide product (emulsifiable concentrate, wettable powder, etc.), application rate, the species of bee used in the cage assay and the duration residues were allowed to weather. We removed any trials with only a single weathering period because these could not be used to calculate residual time. We also removed studies if they did not specify application rates, or percentage mortality and if mixtures of active ingredients were used. The EPA includes both M. rotundata and N. melanderi as well as A. mellifera in their published RT25 values but not Bombus. Consequently, we also removed Bombus trials from this analysis since comparison to the EPA would have been impossible.

We used R statistical software (v4.1.1; R Core Team, 2021) along with the package Tidyverse (Wickham et al., 2019) to calculate the RT25 values using regression models where time was the independent variable and percent mortality the dependent variable. We checked for overdispersion in all assays. If the data was not over dispersed, we then calculated the RT25 values through a binomial logistic regression. If the data was over dispersed, we calculated the RT25 values using a quasibinomial logistic regression.

Comparison of RT25 values
We validated the database created from calculated RT25 values (‘Calculation of RT25 values’) by comparing residual times for each active ingredient by application rate, formulation of the product (i.e., emulsifiable concentrate, wettable powder, etc.), and species of bee in the database published by the EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2014). Instead of comparing the RT25 estimates themselves, we compared how each database would categorize a pesticide as having extended residual toxicity or not. For example, if our calculated RT25 value for a pesticide was less than 6 h (i.e., no extended residual toxicity) and EPA indicated the RT25 value was greater than 12 h (i.e., extended residual toxicity), we deemed the two as sufficiently different. Furthermore, we assumed EPA database estimates were accurate. If extended residual toxicity determinations matched those of pesticides from our systematic review, this would mean that we could rely on RT25 estimates for active ingredients that did not appear in the EPA database. In contrast, if there were substantial misalignment among extended residual toxicity determinations between our calculated and USEPA RT25 estimates, we would conclude that our calculation methods significantly differed from EPA’s and our estimates would need to be reevaluated.

We compared RT25 values for bee species across active ingredient, formulation, and application rate. M. rotundata and N. melanderi RT25 values were compared to A. mellifera RT25 values since, currently, the EPA generally only requires registrants to conduct residual toxicity assays for A. mellifera when applying for product registration. In doing so, we were able to determine whether Environmental Hazards language reflects the RT25 estimates of M. rotundata and N. melanderi.

Label language analysis
We created a composite database of RT25 values from the EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2014) supplemented with calculated values based on the findings of ‘Comparison of RT25 values’. To determine if RT25 values correspond with residual toxicity statements under the Environmental Hazard section of pesticide labels, we used an existing database of residual toxicity statements on pesticides labels developed by Bucy & Melathopoulos (2020) and compared it to RT25 values in our composite RT25 database. The database consisted of 232 labels obtained from products that were used: on 12 Oregon crops around bloom (alfalfa seed, apple, blueberry, carrot seed, cherry, clover seed, cranberry, meadowfoam, pear, pumpkin/squash, radish seed, and watermelon) and California almonds, in Oregon Christmas tree fields during peak times of honey bee activity, to control mosquitos any time of the year, and as garden products available throughout the year to Oregon consumers. We excluded labels from this analysis if: (1) the Environmental Hazards indicated the product was not ‘toxic’ or not ‘highly toxic’ to bees. This would mean that the active ingredient has an LD50 for bees of greater than 11µg/bee, in which case the EPA would not have required that the registrant assess the residual toxicity of that product and/or (2) the product was unlikely to result in exposure to bees (e.g., granular formulations). We only used A. mellifera RT25 values in this analysis since residual toxicity language on pesticide labels is specific to this species (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2012b). Similar to Bucy & Melathopoulos (2020), We interpreted pesticides with short residual toxicity (RT25 <8 h) as corresponding to the statement: “Do not apply…while bees…are actively foraging the treatment area” and those with extended residual toxicity (RT25 >8 h) if accompanied with the statement: “Do not apply…if bees…are foraging the treatment area” found in EPA label language guidance (Fig. 1; United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2012b). We compared the RT25 values to the residual toxicity statements on labels for the same formulation (e.g., emulsifiable concentrate, wettable powder, etc.) of the same active ingredients between the calculated RT25 values and the pesticide.

The following assumptions were made regarding the interpretation of slight variation from EPA guidance when reviewing labels. “Bees are least active” was interpreted as “Do not apply…while bees…are actively foraging the treatment area” and “Bees may forage” was interpreted as “Do not apply…if bees…are foraging the treatment area”. If no label language associated with RT25 values was present on the label, the data from that label was included as “N/A” in analysis. If no acute toxicity language was present on the label suggesting a LD50 of greater than 11 µg/bee, we excluded the active ingredient from our analysis. If an active ingredient had an LD50 greater than 11 µg/bee, EPA would not require an acute or residual toxicity statement on the product label.

We determined misalignment between the Environmental Hazards and RT25 estimates based on the extended residual toxicity threshold (see ‘Comparison of RT25 values’). For example, if a label suggested an RT25 value less than 8 h but the database indicated an RT25 estimate that was greater than 8 h, we deemed the label language as not aligning. If a label was not aligning, we further categorized the labels as either having language that was interpreted as a longer RT25 value than we had calculated or as having language that was interpreted as a shorter RT25 value than we had calculated. Many labels had language that corresponded with RT25 values but neither EPA nor the literature examined during the systematic review had information on the active ingredient in the product or a similar formulation to compare the two. These labels were included in the analysis as labels that had “RT25 values missing”.

,,"
Almost three quarters of the studies (70%) analyzed used EPA’s recommended leaf foliage as the treated plant material placed in cages during the residual toxicity trials, with around a quarter of the studies using other materials such as flowers. In all studies, bees stocked in cages with treated plant material were fed sucrose syrup ad libitum. A majority of studies (69%) aligned with the EPA recommendation for a 50% (wt:wt) sucrose to water solution (Fig. 2). The temperature at which bees were incubated during the residual toxicity test varied greatly among the studies. Most studies incubated bees outside the temperature range of 25−35 °C as recommended by the EPA (Fig. 2), tending to incubate at cooler temperatures. The crop used in studies was evenly distributed between the EPA recommendation of alfalfa and other crops. The studies that did not use alfalfa used, in descending order of frequency, cotton, white clover, strawberry, and sunflower. About half of the studies (48%) reported that there were 25 bees placed in the cage for each residual toxicity trial as recommended by the EPA, with remaining studies ranging from 10 to 106 bees per cage. On average, trials using A. mellifera had more bees (56) per cage compared to M. rotundata (24 bees per cage) and N. melanderi (20 bees per cage). The age of the bees used during the residual toxicity trial mostly deviated across studies with almost half of studies (46%) using an older age "

There was general agreement on whether an active ingredient had extended residual toxicity (i.e., an RT25 value >8h) between our systematic review and EPA’s database. We found only one deviation across 57 comparable studies of the same active ingredient and application rate. This agreement is remarkable since key aspects of the test methodology were not standardized. Our systematic review RT25 estimates were often within 1–3 h of those published by the EPA. For example, we calculated the RT25 for chlorpyrifos formulated as an emulsifiable concentrate on A. mellifera as 17 h compared to the EPA database estimate of 16 h. However, the approach used in this analysis to compare in terms of the extended residual toxicity threshold instead of point estimates may have reduced the influence of methodological variation. Using the extended residual toxicity threshold, the RT25 value for the pyrethroid insecticide fenpropathrin at 0.4 lbs ai/A for A. mellifera was determined to be greater than 8 h while the EPA reported the value as less than 336 h. Thus, we would deem these two values as the same, because they both support a conclusion of extended residual toxicity, even though the actual estimate of RT25 beyond the 8 h threshold remains unresolved. Nevertheless, the general agreement between studies on extended residual toxicity is remarkable and suggests that RT25 estimates are relatively insensitive to variation in lab technique and weathering conditions."
,,"Our preliminary finding that lab methodology and field weathering conditions are not important sources of variation for RT25 should be confirmed experimentally. With respect to lab methodology, we think three factors warrant closer examination, namely the temperature at which the assay is performed, the number of bees held in each test cage and the age of bee used in the test. We report considerable variation in the temperature bees are exposed to in test cage, with temperatures tending to be lower on average compared to EPA guidance. Cooler temperatures could decrease bee activity, leading to less overall contact with the pesticide residue and shorter residual toxicity values (Corbet et al., 1993). The number of bees in test cages may also influence RT25 values by concentrating/diluting the pesticide across fewer/greater numbers of bees, resulting in shorter/longer RT25 values. For example, a cage with 500 bees walking over 10g of pesticide contaminated leaf material may ultimately receive a lower dose per bee than if only 10 bees were walking over the same material over the same period of time. We observed that M. rotundata and N. melanderi had, on average, fewer bees per cage compared to A. mellifera which could lead to more contact per bee to the pesticide residues. Most studies deviated from the age of bees recommended by the EPA; however, using less than one day old bees may be distorting, as foraging age bees, which are typically bees that are least three weeks old, are the bees likely to contact weathered residues in the field. Notably, a factor that was largely omitted from most studies was a description of the weathering conditions, such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, and cloud cover. Potentially, weathering conditions may have a larger impact on RT25 estimates than variation in laboratory methodology.

We observed trends in RT25 values among different rates and formulations of active ingredients. Typically, the higher the application rate of a pesticides, the longer the calculated RT 25 values. For example, the calculated RT25 value for the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos emulsifiable concentrate with A. mellifera was 17 h at the rate of 0.25 lb ai/A and 99 h RT25 time at 0.5 lb ai/A. This suggests that RT25 may be different for different application rates, which draws into question the premise of the Pollinating Insect Hazard Statement, where a single residual toxicity statement is meant to cover multiple different use patterns of a pesticide, such as different rates. Notably, new guidance issued by EPA (2017) moves away from relying on the Pollinating Insect Hazard Statement to convey residual toxicity estimates, relying more on specific use directions, where rate and crop are specified. Our results suggest this shift will provide applicators with more guidance on the specific residual times they might experience in the field.

The species of bee used to estimate RT25 exhibited notable patterns that should be further investigated. In general, we observed that for the same active ingredient applied at the same rate and formulation M. rotundata had longer RT25 times compared to A. mellifera, and that N. melanderi had both shorter and longer RT25 times compared to A. mellifera. Emulsifiable concentrates were associated with the largest difference in RT25 estimates among species, with M. rotundata consistently having longer RT25 values than A. mellifera for these formulations. It is unclear what is the source of these patterns. One hypothesis is that M. rotundata may be more susceptible to pesticides as this species lacks the ability to detoxify certain synthetic insecticides that are normally metabolized by other bee species (Hayward et al., 2019). Certainly, several studies have indicated differential toxicity of pesticides to different bee taxa (Johansen et al., 1983a; Johansen et al., 1983b; Mayer, Kovacs & Lunden, 1998; Devillers & Pham-Delegue, 2002). Another possible explanation for the difference between bee species could be their size difference. M. rotundata has the smallest average size of the three bees we analyzed and, therefore, would have the highest ratio of surface area to body volume. The higher surface area to body volume ratio results in a higher rate in the accumulation of lethal dosages over time (Johansen et al., 1983a; Johansen et al., 1983b; Wisk et al., 2014) potentially resulting in longer RT25 times for smaller bees, for a given toxicity of a pesticide. Little research has been done into the effects of differing formulations on the residual toxicity across bee species. A species comparative study would be useful to determine what variables (e.g., differences in behavior, different physiology, etc.) contribute to the differing residual toxicity values. Currently, the EPA publicly reports (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2014) RT25 times primarily for A. mellifera, with limited data available on other species of pollinating bees. Researchers also primarily use A. mellifera when conducting pesticide risk assessments which lead to large knowledge gaps for other pollinating bees impacted by pesticides (Tosi et al., 2022). Differences in species residual toxicity times have been noticed in the past (Johansen et al., 1983a; Johansen et al., 1983b; Mayer, Lunden & Jasso, 1997) and variation in pesticide sensitivity among bee species has been shown which could suggest variation in residual toxicity times (Arena & Sgolastra, 2014). However, there have been no in-depth studies designed to comparatively characterize RT25 estimates for different species, let alone resolve the mechanisms by which bees may respond to the dissipation of residues differently. Our results suggest that honey bee residual toxicity assay results may not be generalizable to other bee species as has been done in the past. Variation in RT25 estimates for different bee species would be important information for pesticide applicators, particularly if they are using residual times for bee species with the shortest RT25 values.

The finding from our study that is of greatest concern to pesticide applicators was widespread misalignment between RT25 values and statements of residual toxicity in the Pollinating Insect Hazard Statement. Of the pesticide labels we were able to compare to calculated RT25 values, almost a third were inaccurate in the wording of their Pollinating Insect Hazard Statement. For example, the formulated end-use product Perm-Up 3.2 EC (USEPA registration number 70506-9) containing the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin indicates the product should not be applied while bees are “actively visiting” suggesting a less than 8-hour residual toxicity time. However, the residual toxicity studies for permethrin consistently indicated RT25 values greater than 8 h even at the lowest application rate calculated, 0.05 lb ai/A. Although this finding is concerning, some of these discrepancies may arise from our assumption that all pesticides with the same active ingredient and applied at the same rate have similar RT25 values. Potentially, pesticide products may have different residual times owing to features independent of the active ingredient, such as inert ingredients. Our assumption that RT25 can be generalized across products containing the same active ingredient is supported by our findings that RT25 estimates were largely consistent for active ingredients across studies and relative to estimates published by EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2014). Nevertheless, we suggest caution in interpreting our results since the number of different products used to estimate RT25 values for each active ingredient tended to be dwarfed by the total number of registered products containing those ingredients on the market. Regardless, our study indicates that either there is high variability in residual toxicity between pesticides containing the same active ingredients, which calls into the question efforts like the EPA’s to publish RT25 values based on active ingredients, or the Pollinating Insect Hazard Statement on existing pesticide labels aligns poorly with RT25 values. Our data currently suggests the latter problem predominates, resulting in pesticide applicators lacking a reliable piece of information to mitigate exposure to bees during bloom.

One thing is clear from our study: there remain large gaps in our database of RT25 estimates. Although this database is the most comprehensive to date, and expands on published values by the EPA, the lack of publicly accessible RT25 estimates is something we hope researchers will make a concerted effort to address. We also encourage the EPA to review its existing data from registrants, which is unavailable to researchers, pesticide applicators and the public, and fill gaps in its public-facing database. Alternatively, the EPA could develop a mechanism to release registrant-collected residual toxicity data to the public to enable researchers to develop such a database independently. While estimating residual toxicity has been a part of the pesticide risk assessment process for decades, its relevance continues with new guidance around label language that foregrounds RT25 values beyond the Environmental Hazard section to the crop-specific directions for use on the label (United States Protection Agency, 2017). The need to create a basis for evaluation of these changes is not only important for pesticide applicators who are seeking instruction to protect bees from exposure, but for the sustainable management of domesticated managed bee stocks and wild bee communities.

Conclusions
Through our efforts, we were successfully able to create a compendium of RT25 values that could be used to determine if pesticide label language aligns with calculated active ingredient RT25 values. There was noticeable variation in species and application rate which could call into question whether a single Pollinating Insects Hazards Statement is sufficient to fully communicate the hazards of a pesticide product. Further comparison of the calculated values to published EPA values revealed that lab methodology does not seem to affect RT25 values as seen from comparison of study values to the EPA, though field conditions during the weathering of the pesticide may need to be explored further. Comparing a combined database of published EPA values and our calculated RT25 values to label language showed significant misalignment in Pollinating Insect Hazard Statements. The variation in residual toxicity remains an emerging field of research that must be addressed to ensure the applications of pesticides is occurring in a safe manner to minimize the risk towards pollinating bees."
,,"Abstract
As has long been the case for conventional agriculture, organic agriculture is increasingly characterized by the consolidation of production into the hands of larger operations. Using historical pesticide applications records from the California Pesticide Use Report (PUR), this study identified individual organic fields, to document the occurrence of cropland consolidation, and assess the correlation between cropland consolidation and pesticide use. Our results show that pesticide use is correlated with the consolidation of organic cropland. Farms with more organic acreage applied sulfur and fixed copper pesticides more frequently after controlled for the crop type and field size. As the result, larger farms had greater environmental impacts on surface water and smaller impacts on soil and air because sulfur and fixed copper are more toxic to fish and algae, and less toxic to earthworms and have lower Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions than other pesticides used in organic fields.

1. Introduction
Organic agriculture is often proposed as an essential part of sustainable food systems (Muller et al., 2017). Existing studies have evaluated the environmental performance of organic agriculture as a system and compared it with conventional agriculture from many aspects (Gomiero et al., 2011; Hartmann et al., 2015; Pimentel et al., 2005; Tuomisto et al., 2012; Seufert and Ramankutty, 2017).

Consumers often associate organic agriculture with small farms and diverse crop production (Adams and Salois, 2010), which might not be true anymore for organic agriculture in California because the consolidation process had been clearly documented for the organic food processing sector (Howard, 2009) and the U.S. agriculture in general (MacDonald et al., 2018).

Pesticide pressures and pesticide use are found to be correlated with farm size and field size (Wu et al., 2018; Rosenheim et al., 2022). If large organic farms apply pesticides differently from small ones, the consolidation into larger operations could undermine the perception of organic agriculture as environmentally friendly and hinder the development of organic agriculture.

Most pesticide products used in organic agriculture are generally less toxic than their conventional counterparts, but their reduced efficacy could drive higher application rates, which makes the overall environmental impact of organic agriculture less obvious. Meanwhile, certain pesticides used in organic agriculture have been found to be more toxic than conventional pesticides targeting the same pest (Biondi et al., 2012; Bahlai et al., 2010). Pesticide use in organic agriculture required special focus because study has shown that pesticide use is mainly driven by the crop value (Rosenheim et al., 2020).

Few studies have investigated the pesticide use patterns for organic fields and their environmental impacts. (Larsen et al., 2021) showed that organic fields are 30% more likely to not be sprayed by any pesticide compared to conventional fields. But, their study limited to productions only in the Kern county, where carrots accounted for 25% of the organic acreage. Therefore, more evidence is needed to: (1) quantitatively describe pesticide use in organic agriculture; (2) assess its environmental impacts for ecosystems on a large scale across numerous crops over a long time period; (3) and identify their relation with changes in farm size.

This study focus on how large organic farms apply pesticides differently, which also contributes to the large body of literature on farm size issues that started as least from (Sen, 1962). Researchers have found that farming practices involving labor, output price, and technology adoption vary significantly across farms with different sizes (Feder, 1985; Barrett, 1996; Fan and Chan-Kang, 2005; Rada and Fuglie, 2019). While previous studies emphasized on the economic outcomes such as productivity and poverty alleviation, our analysis focuses on the environmental impacts that resulted from changes in pesticide use, which helps us to understand more about the future of organic agriculture as the sector expanded.

In this study, we use California's Pesticide Use Report (PUR) database to identify individual organic fields, characterize pesticide use and cropland consolidation patterns, and assess the environmental impacts of pesticide use in California organic agriculture. California continues to be the leading state as a producer of organic crops in the United States, accounting for 12% of organic cropland and 50% of crop sales value (NASS USDA, 2020). California's unique Pesticide Use Report (PUR) database has very detailed and long-term data, which allows the identification of individual organic fields based on their historical pesticide use records. The PUR database contains information on all commercial agricultural pesticide use in California since 1995, including information on the chemicals used, crops and acreages for millions of individual applications. In total, >50,000 organic farms 120,000 organic fields were identified in the California from 1995 to 2015.

The PUR database has three merits in terms of studying organic agriculture. First, the organic crop production in California has a diverse crop portfolio which provides the opportunity to investigate how pesticide use and the consolidation process interact with changes in the crop mix. Fruits and vegetables received higher price premium compare to other organic produce (Carlson and Jaenicke, 2016), which creates different level of incentives for growers to adopt the organic production and apply pesticide. Secondly, the PUR database covers pesticide use information since 1995, which is 6 years before the launch of the National Organic Program (NOP). In Läpple and Van Rensburg (2011), the authors found that growers who entered organic production after the supporting policy was launched are more likely to be profit-driven and less environmentally concerned than growers who began organic production before any supporting policy was in place. The PUR database allows us to see the policy impact on pesticide use and cropland consolidation. Thirdly, the PUR database contains detailed location information, which is used by Zhan and Zhang (2012) to match with other geographic databases and calculate the environmental impacts on surface water, groundwater, soil, air, and pollinators from pesticide use. The environmental impact measure used in this study is more accurate and detailed than previous studies.

2. Data and Methods
In this section, we develop a method to identify organic fields and assess pesticide use in organic agriculture using the PUR database. Organic crop acreages identified from the PUR database are compared with data from other sources to discuss of our method. The Pesticide Use Risk Evaluation (PURE) index from (Zhan and Zhang, 2012) is used to evaluate the environmental impacts of pesticide usage. The impact of cropland consolidation on the pesticide use patterns and the environmental impacts of organic agriculture are quantified using the fixed-effect regression method.

2.1. The PUR Database on Pesticide Usage and Crop Fields
The main database used in this study is the PUR database, which contains detailed information on location, timing, amount and name of product applied, application methods, acreage treated, and crop treated. Since 1990, all agricultural pesticide use information in California has been collected by the County Agricultural Commissioners (CAC), who in turn, report it to the California Department of Pesticide Regulation (CDPR), which publishes the PUR database annually. The PUR database is the largest and most complete dataset on pesticide use in the world and it contains >3 million application records for agricultural use each year. Numerous studies in environmental science, plant pathology, and agricultural economics have been conducted based on the PUR database (Reynolds et al., 2005; Larsen et al., 2017; Davidson, 2004; Lybbert et al., 2016).

Non-chemical pest management practices, such as biological, cultural, and mechanical/physical controls, are not recorded in the PUR database. As a result, this study focuses only on the potential impacts posed by pesticide usage in organic agriculture. The PUR database from 1995 to 2017 were used in this study for two reasons. First, this time frame provides coverage before and after the launch of the National Organic Program (NOP) in 2001, which allows us to determine any effects of that policy change. Secondly, while the PUR database are available from 1990 onward, the data quality is known to be more variable in the early years (Wilhoit et al., 2001).

Pesticide use information in the PUR database is available at the field level. In this paper, a “field” is defined using two variables in the PUR database, “GROWER_ID” and “SITE_LOC_ID”. “GROWER_ID” is a number assigned to a grower or operator by CAC on their pesticide permit, and it remains constant for the same grower over time. “SITE_LOC_ID” is a code assigned by 5 CAC on the pesticide permit which indicates a particular location (field) where an application may occur. For a given field, this code may change from year to year, as it was assigned by growers, which creates some uncertainties in identifying organic fields across years. This uncertainty is accounted for in the analyses, as described below.

For each agricultural pesticide application, the PUR database specifies the location of application in the variable “COMTRS”, which stands for the county, meridian, township, range, and section as defined by the Public Lands Survey mapping system (PLSS). This information allows us to locate which section does the field belong and aggregate pesticide usage at the 1 × 1 mile PLSS section-level, which is the finest spatial scale reported in the PUR database. This detailed section-level analysis of the spatial distribution of organic fields in California and, how it has changed over time, is only possible using our method for identifying organic production fields in the PUR database.

In the PUR database, acreage information is recorded as both treated acreage and planted acreage. The former represents the acres physically treated in a pesticide application while the latter remains constant for the field within a year. However, previous experience with the PUR database by this research group has demonstrated that planted acreage is not consistently reliable for annual crops, so in this study, we use the maximum treated acreage in a given year as the acreage for each field for annual crops. This approach assumes that the entire field is treated with pesticide at least once per year. If this assumption is invalid, then the planted acreage will be under-counted. As presented below, the validity of this approach is supported by the consistency of state-scale crop acreages that are generated from the PUR database with those from other data sources.

One caveat of the PUR database for organic production is that since 2000, pesticide products deemed as having “minimum impacts” are no longer required to be registered with CDPR, which exempts them from the pesticide use reporting requirement. A detailed list of these pesticide ingredients can be found in the California Code of Regulations section 6147 (CDPR, 2000). 6 Most ingredients exempted from registration are natural or naturally-derived products (e.g., garlic oil), which could presumably be used in organic agriculture and have impacts on the surrounding environment. However, these exempted ingredients are not widely applied, based on their minimal amounts of usage in the PUR database prior to 2000 when they were still required to be reported. Therefore, this issue is not likely to invalidate our results, especially because the number of fields where only such ingredients were applied before 2000 is small.

For convenience, some chemically-related individual active ingredients (AIs) were grouped together, such as combining the many different strains of Bacillus thuringiensis, which target different insects and are each treated as a distinct AI in the PUR database, into a single “microbial” group. A detailed list of microbials is available in the appendix A. The group of “Copper, fixed” includes the summation of copper, copper oxychloride, copper octanoate, copper oxide, and copper hydroxide; and the two forms of copper sulfate (basic copper sulfate and copper sulfate pentahydrate).

2.2. Identifying Organic Fields from the PUR Database
Organic growers are required to comply with a set of crop management standards, regarding seeds and planting stock practices, soil fertility and crop nutrient management, pest, weed, and disease management, and crop rotation among others (NOP, 2001). The most relevant requirement for this study is that there is a 36-month transition period between the last application of any prohibited substance under organic regulations and officially recognized organic production. Our field identification method relies on this requirement. First, we constructed a list of allowed and prohibited substances based on various sources (as described in the appendix A). Second, we checked each field in the PUR database to see which AIs were applied over the past three years. If there were no applications of any prohibited ingredients, then the field was considered organic as of that year. Organic growers who do not use any chemical tools at all to manage pests and weeds are missing from the PUR database entirely, and therefore not identified in this study. However, 7 based on acreage comparisons between the PUR database and other data sources, those growers appear to operate a very limited number of acres.

Theoretically, a field could comply with the pest, weed, and disease management standards of the NOP while violating other standards (such as applying synthetic fertilizers) and still not qualify for organic production. Because the PUR database only contains pesticide use information, our method cannot distinguish such fields from actual certified organic fields. On the other hand, growers could follow organic farming practices but choose not to certify their fields for various reasons. However, as mentioned above, the amounts of acreage in these categories must not be very substantial because our PUR-derived organic crop acreages agree with those from CAC compiled sources, suggesting that our method is valid.

One caveat of this method is the consistency of field information in the PUR database from year to year. As mentioned previously, the “SITE_LOCATION_ID” on pesticide permits, a number chosen by growers or assigned by county, indicates a physical field location, but the ID number may change from year to year. When that ID changes, which happens for various reasons including land transaction between growers, a new “field” appears in the PUR database, for which we do not have information on its historical (i.e., over the previous three years) pesticide applications. In this situation, we assume for annual crops that the land was fallow until a new “SITE_LOCATION_ID” was assigned. Sample cost studies have shown that it is not profitable to produce under the organic standard without earning an organic price premium (Holtz et al., 2016; McGourty et al., 2016; Abraben et al., 2017).

This assumption could overestimate the organic acreage when a conventional field is given a new id and the grower use only pesticide AIs that are allowed in organic agriculture. We will verify this assumption by counting the share of organic allowed AIs used within a field every year. If conventional fields are never treated by only organic allowed AIs, then we can distinguish fields under difference status by using one-year of pesticide use record, which supports our assumption. Pasture and rangeland have unique pest management practices and enormous acreage, but they are not covered in this study as they do not suit our primary purpose of evaluating the environmental impacts of pesticide use in organic crop fields.

One could suggest to identify organic fields from the PUR database based on what pesticide products were used instead of AIs. Currently, pesticide manufacturers could register their products with two agencies at various costs, the Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI) and the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA), and obtain a label to show that their products are allowed to use in organic agriculture. The merit of this approach is to identify organic fields more precisely because certain pesticide products contain inert ingredients that are prohibited in organic agriculture which are categorized incorrectly if we only focus on AIs. However, this merit is no longer significant if conventional growers always use AIs that are prohibited in organic agriculture, which will be checked as mentioned before.

There are two disadvantages of using pesticide products to identify organic fields in the PUR database. First, not all pesticide products allowed in organic agriculture are registered. This is a significant drawback because our analysis started from 1995 but the first OMRI list was published in 1998 and earliest registration record from WSDA was in 1999. In addition, for products such as dusting sulfur, information asymmetry is not an issue because farmers are certain that they are allowed in organic agriculture, which makes product registrations not profitable. Second, products registered with OMRI and WSDA cannot be easily matched with products used in the PUR database. Product names slightly vary across systems. For example, product Nu-Film® P is called “MILLER NU-FILM-P"" in the PUR database, “Miller™ Nu Film® P Spreader Sticker” in the OMRI list, and “Nu Film P"" in the WSDA list. Both OMRI and WSDA lists do not provide EPA registration numbers, which is also missing for some products in the PUR database. More details about two products list are discussed in the appendix A. The main analysis will be repeated for fields treated with organic allowed pesticide product for three years to show results under different organic identification methods.

2.3. Other Data Sources for Organic Acreage
To test the validity of our method for identifying organic fields, we compared organic acreages derived from the PUR database with those available in other data sources, primarily from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA). The acreage data in each source were collected using different approaches and therefore it is common to observe differences.

2.3.1. CDFA Organic Registration Data
The California Organic Products Act requires an annual registration of all organic producers, handlers, and processors, regardless of their annual sales. Producers report acreage and total sales, expected or actual, for each crop they grow organically. Data for 1998 to 2016 have been summarized to the state-crop level in previous studies (Klonsky and Richter, 2005a; Klonsky and Richter, 2005b; Klonsky and Richter, 2011; Klonsky and Healy, 2013; Wei et al., 2020). After 2018, the registration data was summarized at county-crop level for a limited number of crop categories (CDFA, 2020). An acreage comparison is made for 2019 in appendix A.

2.3.2. USDA Certification and Organic Survey Data
The USDA's Economic Research Service (ERS) collected acreage data for seven crops at the state level from USDA-accredited state and private organic certifiers between 2000 and 2011 (ERS, 2011). However, the data only cover seven crops/crop groups and certified organic growers (growers with less than $ 5000 annual organic sales are exempted from certification). Meanwhile, USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) conducted five organic surveys between 1995 and 2017, which gathered organic crop acreage at the state level. However, responses to those surveys were voluntary and the average response rate for California was 69% (NASS USDA, 2010; NASS USDA, 2016b; NASS USDA, 2016a; NASS USDA, 2017). Therefore, we used the NASS survey data only when the USDA ERS data series were not available to construct the crop acreage data series.

2.3.3. California Strawberry Commission (CSC) Survey Data
For strawberries, the CSC collects organic data through its annual survey (CSC, 2021). The CSC data provide other information in addition to acreage and total sales, such as strawberry varieties and harvest timing. The response rate for this survey is unknown, which limits our understanding of its data quality. All three of these data sources were aggregated by crop (for the limited number of crops they include) or county, and individual field-level data are not available publicly. This limitation underscores the value of the PUR database and our method for providing unique information regarding organic crop production in California over space and time.

2.4. Assessing Potential Environmental Impacts of Pesticide Use
For pesticide applications on the identified organic fields in the PUR database, the PURE index was used to assess the potential environmental impacts (Zhan and Zhang, 2012). The PURE index is calculated for five different environmental dimensions: surface water, groundwater, soil, air, and pollinators. Individual index values are normalized to range from 0 (negligible impact) to 100 (highest impact).

For surface water, groundwater, soil, and pollinators, index values are calculated based on predicted environmental concentrations and standard toxicity values for endpoint organisms. The toxicity is commonly measured by the half maximal effective concentration (EC50), which is the dissolved concentration (mg/L) needed for a response halfway between the baseline and maximum lethality. A larger EC50 is associated with a less toxic chemical.

For surface water, the PURE index value is determined mainly by toxicities of AIs to aquatic organisms. The PURE soil index value is estimated based specifically on the toxicity for earthworms, which is measured by the dose that is lethal to 50% of the test population (LC50). The PURE index value for air is determined by the level of Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions. PURE index values are not directly comparable across different environmental aspects because the endpoint organisms are not the same.

The PURE index values are calculated for each AI in each pesticide application for each field. These AI-level disaggregated index values are then summed at the field-level, within each environmental aspect, to provide an overall assessment.

The algorithm of the PURE index assumes fields are heterogeneous across sections and includes the PLSS-level environmental variables for calculation. For example, fields that locate in sections closer to the river will have a greater PURE index score regarding surface water comparing to fields locate in other section when holding everything else constant. This is a major advantage of the PURE index over other methods commonly used in the literature for assessing the environmental impacts of pesticide use, such as the Environmental Impact Quotient (Kovach et al., 1992) or the pesticide load (Möhring et al., 2021).

2.5. Consolidation of Organic Cropland and its Impact on Pesticide Use
The consolidation of cropland into larger operations has been a persistent phenomenon in conventional agriculture since the 1930s (Gardner, 2009; Hart et al., 2003; MacDonald et al., 2018). Changes in farm size, measured in acreage, may create environmental concerns due to the differing production practices in larger and smaller operations. The empirical strategy of this paper has three parts: (1) First, we will estimate the correlation between organic farm size and environmental impacts of pesticide use; (2) Then, we will discuss changes in the overall pesticide use behavior by focusing on the total pesticides used per acre and the total treated acreage per acre as organic farm size changes;(3) Finally, we will study the use of particular pesticide AIs, including total amount, intensity, and frequency, that differs in larger and smaller organic farms. Together, our empirical strategy aims to identify the effect of farm size on environmental impacts of pesticide use and links it to specific pesticide use behaviors that vary across farms with difference acreage. The overall effects of farm acreage on the environmental impacts is identified using the following regression model:
(1)
where 
 is the one of the PURE index values in field 
 at year 
. The variable of interest is 
, which represents the total organic acreage, measured in units of 1000 acres, operated by grower 
 who manages field 
 at year 
. The years of farming observed in the PUR database for grower 
 is 
. There are three fixed effects in this model: grower fixed effect 
, year fixed effect 
, and crop fixed effect 
. Eq. 1 is also use to estimate the correlation between farm size and the overall pesticide use, where 
 is the total pesticide used per acre and the total acreage treated per acre. Environmental variables such as rainfall are not included in the model because the PURE index values are calculated based on those environmental conditions.

The standard error is clustered at grower level which assumes the decision making process of pesticide application is correlated across fields that are managed by the same grower but independent across growers. This assumption is based on the fact that most pesticide products and certain pesticide application equipment and services can be shared across fields and crops. Researchers have found that the usage of pesticides and fertilizers is correlated between growers Conley and Udry (2010).

Including the fixed effects and the farming experience variable help to mitigate the bias caused by the existence of unobserved factors (and therefore omitted variables) that influence the outcomes of interest. The data collecting process of the PUR database is designed to keep growers' identity confidential, which poses obstacles for researches. We cannot not retrieve information such as gender, age, and perceptions of environmental issues, which are commonly used in studies focused on pesticide use or organic farming. One could conduct surveys personally and match the results with the PUR database as in Lybbert et al. (2016). However, that approach often times is restricted by funding limits and hard to provide a broad view of topic of interests. We add a grower fixed effect in the model, which captures grower-level characteristics that remain unchanged over time, such as gender. Since grower id contains county information in the PUR database, the grower fixed effect also serves as a county fixed effect which helps to absorb differences across counties.

Pesticide use is determined by pest population which varies from year to year due to temperature and precipitation changes. The farm size is governed by the equilibrium prices which also changes over time. The year fixed effect in the model will capture such co-movement so that it does not bias the estimation of 
. Farm acreage and pesticide portfolio are difference across crops. Field crops such as rice are generally cultivated at a large scale and require less pesticide comparing to fruit crops such as strawberries. The crop fixed effect included in the model ensures that our estimations reveal the correlation between farm size and pesticide use within crops. Together the grower, crop, and year fixed effects serve the same purpose of helping to mitigate the omitted variables bias. A robustness check is included to show estimation results under different combinations of fixed effects.

For a particular AI/AI group, the pesticide use behavior can be measured by two variables: (1) the frequency of pesticide applications and (2) the intensity of pesticide use in each application. The correlation between organic farm acreage and use of particular pesticide AIs is identified using the following regression model with the grower, year, and crop fixed effects:
(2)
where 
 is the total pesticide used per acre, the number of applications per field, and the application rate of AI/AI group 
 in field 
 at year 
. The application rate measures the use intensity, which is defined as the total pounds of pesticide used divided by the total treated acreage for each field and AI/AI group. For example, if the field is 2 acres and it is sprayed three times a year with 5 pounds of AI each time, then total AI used is 15 pounds, the total treated acreage 6 acres, and the application rate is 2.5. Together, the number of applications and the application rate capture the pesticide use behavior.

The correlation between organic farm size and different measures of pesticide use is conducted for fields treated with AIs allowed in organic agriculture for three years as well as one year. The same estimation is repeated for fields treated with pesticide products allowed in organic agriculture for three years. As a robustness check, results are compared for organic fields identified under difference criteria.

3. Results and Discussion
This section presents data on the organic fields identified from the PUR database along with acreage summary for the top organic crops. The comparisons of organic acreages reported in different data sources are made to examine the validity of our approach. The environmental impacts for pesticides used on organic fields are assessed using the PURE index. Finally, the trend of cropland consolidation is presented and the effect of consolidation on pesticide use and the environmental impacts are quantified.

3.1. Organic Fields Identified in the PUR Database
Fig. 1 maps organic fields identified from the PUR database for all crops. Each pixel represents a section with any organic acreage. They are color-coded based on the number of organic acres in that section. Organic fields were more widespread in 2017 (Fig. 2B) than in 1995 (Fig. 2A). The number of sections with organic cropland increased from 1451 to 3008. Also, there was a pronounced shift toward more organic acreage within sections. By definition, each section contains 640 acres of cropland at a maximum. In 1995, only 5% of sections had >100 acres of organic cropland, which increased to 18% in 2017. In particular, substantial growth 15 was observed in Monterey, Fresno, and Imperial counties (outlined in red). Monterey County has the most organic acreage and the greatest number of sections with organic fields, increasing from 54 sections in 1995 to 202 sections in 2017. The top five organic crops in Monterey (leaf lettuce, spinach, broccoli, strawberry, and celery) accounted for 73% of total organic acreage in 2017. As the leading county, Monterey had 47% of the state's organic lettuce and 61% of California's organic strawberry acreage in 2017. Details on total organic acreage, average farm size, and number of organic farms for each county are available in the appendix A.
"
,,"To valid our approach using AIs to identify organic fields in the PUR database, we count, for each field-year, the number AIs used and the number of organic allowed AIs used, which give us the share of organic allowed AIs in all AIs used. If the share equals to 1, all AIs used in that field are allowed in organic agriculture.

Fig. 2 shows that 40% of fields are located at the left end of the horizontal axis, which means none of the organic allowed AI was used in those fields. The pesticide AI portfolio is very different between conventional and organic fields, which makes AI an appropriate criterion to distinguish organic fields from conventional ones.

3.2. Organic Crop Acreage in the PUR Database
Table 1 shows organic acreage for the top 10 crops (ranked by organic acreage in 2015) during the 21-year period from 1995 to 2015 and the total crop acreage for both conventional and organic production in 2015. Eight of the ten crops are fruits and vegetables. The remaining two are rice and almonds. Overall, the total organic acreage of these crops grew from 46,884 acres in 1995 to 162,389 acres in 2015, an increase of more than threefold. The first two columns show that organic acreage remained relatively stable in the five years before the NOP was established in 2001. Acreages of most of these crops grew dramatically in the subsequent years.

Note: Total acreage includes all acreage defined as either organic or conventional.


Total acreage can be less informative than the acreage shares of organic production if one tries to infer the importance of organic production for various crops. The shares of organic acreage relative to total acreage, listed in the last column of Table 1, show a wide variation across crops. For wine grapes, processing tomatoes, rice, and almonds organic acreage accounted for <5% of total crop acreage, which aligns with the average value of 3.4% of cropland in California that is certified organic (NASS USDA, 2016a). Meanwhile, fresh fruits and vegetables have a much higher share of organic acreage. For carrots, leaf lettuce, and spinach, 25%, 11%, and 18% of acreage respectively was devoted to organic production (Table 1). Among crops not shown in Table 1, kale, blackberries, and blueberries also have large organic shares, where organic production accounted for 55%, 36%, and 25% of their total acreage, respectively, in 2015 (data not shown). This phenomenon can be explained by the economic motivations for organic growers. More acreage will be cultivated as organic if the price premium for organic products is substantial compared to the increase in costs, and fresh produce, such as salad mixes, has a higher organic price premium than other products (Carlson and Jaenicke, 2016).

3.3. Organic Acreage Comparisons
Measures of State-specific total organic acreage from different data sources are compared for all seven crops/crop groups available in the USDA organic certification and survey data (ERS, 2011) plus strawberries from the CSC survey data (CSC, 2021). Among these eight crops/crop groups, four of them are annual and the others are perennial crops. Their organic acreage is plotted in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 below.
"
,,"As mentioned previously, then data sources have different reporting requirements and discrepancies can be caused by a variety of reasons that apply to all crops. In the CDFA registration data, new organic growers report their expected acreage for the next year. If growers decide not to engage in that expected organic production, their registration records remain in the system, which could produce an inaccurate inflation in acreage data, especially for crops that went through a rapid growth of organic production. Growers with less than $5000 annual organic sales are required to register their production with CDFA but do not have to apply for organic certification. So their acreage might not be counted in USDA data. Both USDA and CDFA data relies on a set of well-defined organic standards and restrictive regulations, which did not exist before 2001.

For perennial crops, new registrations with CDFA or new certifications with USDA must include the documentation of orchards before they are fully established (i.e., before pesticides would be used). Therefore, we observe new orchards and vineyards in the USDA and CDFA data before they enter the PUR database. If growers adopt the organic pest management program but do not market their products as organic, their acreage is only covered in the PUR database, not the others.

Meanwhile, discrepancies in acreage are caused by crop specific reasons. For lettuce (Fig. 3B), USDA has consistently reported higher acreage values since 2004. In 2016, the lettuce acreage from the USDA organic survey is more than double the acreage from the CDFA registration data (NASS USDA, 2017). One reason could be potential double or multiple cropping of lettuce in one calendar year. When growers harvested lettuce multiple times from the same field, USDA reported the sum of acres for each harvest while CDFA asked for the size of the field. Our method accounts for this phenomenon by counting days between the first and last pesticide applications. Normally, both leaf and head lettuce require at most 130 days from planting to harvest in California (Smith et al., 2011; Turini et al., 2011). So if two pesticide applications occur >130 days apart for the same field, we assume that the lettuce was harvested twice and the acreage would be doubled. After this adjustment, the PUR database still falls short of the acreage documented in the USDA dataset but is in-between the other two sources since 2003. Before 2003, CDFA had more acreage than the other data series because the crop category “lettuce, salad mix”, which contains arugula, red/green mustard, and other crops (which are listed separately in the PUR database and the USDA data), used to be reported as lettuce.

For strawberries (Fig. 3C), the CSC data always show somewhat less acreage because their data are derived from surveys (rather than required reporting) and the survey response rate is not reported. For apples (Fig. 4A), the organic acreage is small compared other perennial crops, which amplifies the potential measurement errors.

All types of grapes (table, wine, and raisins), are combined in Fig. 4C. The PUR database reported more organic acreage consistently. Abraben et al. (2017) showed that organic labeling generates a meaningful price premium only for low-quality wine, while the price of high-quality wine is actually reduced by consumers' perception of the organic label. This marketing issue creates an incentive for growers to intentionally avoid certifying their organic production in higher end wine grape production. Therefore, we observe more grape acreage following the organic farming practices than certifying as organic.

For tree nuts (almond, chestnut, pecan, pistachio, and walnut), the PUR database reported less organic acreage than the USDA and CDFA sources with a narrowing gap in recent years (Fig. 4D). Tree nut acreage has gone through a tremendous growth phase in California during the past two decades, with almond acreage increasing from 595,000 in 2000 to 1,110,000 in 2015, the period when Fig. 1D indicates that the PUR database is missing large portions of organic acreage (CDFA, 2000; CDFA, 2015). Normally pesticide applications are not required for the first two years in a nut orchard (Duncan et al., 2019; Brar et al., 2015; Grant et al., 2017), which makes the PUR database less reliable for capturing new organic tree nut acreage.

While organic fields without any pesticide applications in a given year are missing from the PUR database, this appears to be only a minor limitation because organic acreage from the PUR database is not consistently smaller than that from the other two sources for all crops. This minor limitation is compensated by the major advantages of the PUR database, i.e., its fine spatial scale 21 and comprehensiveness in terms of all crops, years and counties being included.

3.4. The PURE Index Values
The PURE index values for organic fields are plotted in Fig. 5. The PURE index for air increased steadily from 1995 to 2015, at an average annual growth rate of 4%. Several factors probably contributed, related to overall application rates and the changes in the organic AI portfolio over the years. The PURE index for air is calculated by multiplying the AI application rate by its VOC emission potential, which is a physicochemical property related to its tendency to evaporate or sublimate into the surrounding air. During the study period, the average application rate across all pesticides for organic growers decreased from 9.1 lb./acre in 1995 to 2.9 lb./acre in 2015 in contrast to the increase in the value of the PURE air index. However, the pesticide portfolio changed significantly as organic growers diversified their pesticide AI options and relied less on sulfur products over time. Because dusting sulfur products have zero VOC emission, the increasing applications of virtually any other AIs would have contributed to a steady increase in the PURE index value for air.
"
,,"3.5. Consolidation of Organic Cropland
Management of organic cropland has shifted toward larger farm operations during our study period. The acreage shares of each size class remained relatively stable until 2001 when NOP introduced a national standard for organic crop production and established the foundation of the organic price premium by protecting the integrity of the “organic” distinction (Fig. 6). However, in later years the share of organic acreage operated by farms in larger acreage classes rose. For example, in 2015, 56% of organic cropland was operated by growers with at least 500 acres of organic cropland, up from 15% in 1995. At the other end of the spectrum, growers with 10–50 acres accounted for 18% of organic cropland in 1995, which dropped to 8% in 2015."
,,"As mentioned previously, the observation that organic farms are getting larger could be driven by the change in crop mix instead of the consolidation process. To examine that, we plot the acreage share of each crop category in Fig. 7. The acreage shares of vegetables increased tremendously, from 30% in 1995 to 50% in 2015, while the acreage of grapes and field crops fell. Given that vegetables, such as lettuce and spinach, are produced at a smaller acreage scale than field crops, such as rice, the consolidation process in organic agriculture is profound as shown in the PUR database."
,,"Median crop acreage per grower is another common measure of farm size (MacDonald et al., 2018). By definition, half of growers operate less cropland than the median acreage value, while the other half operate more. Therefore, the median is a more meaningful statistic than the average because it not as sensitive to changes at the extremes. Acreages are not comparable across crops as the revenue per acre varies greatly. However, for any given crop, the change of median acreage over time reveals cropland shifts. Table 2 shows the median crop acreage per grower for the top 10 organic crops."
,,"lthough larger farms continued to add cropland during the study period overall, such consolidation is not a universal pattern for all crops. Table 2 shows that by 2015, two out of ten crops actually had a decrease in median acreage per grower compared to 1995. Spinach growers had the most growth in median acreage, from 2 to 70 acres. Leaf lettuce production also consolidated with the median farm size increasing by 35 acres. The last row of Table 2 reports the median of total organic acreage per farm.

For crops with a lower organic price premium, growers lack the incentive to expand production. Therefore, it is not surprising to see that median acreage decreased for rice. Carrot has gone through the most significant growth of total organic acreage over the past two decades (Table 1). However, as small farms have continued to join in the production of organic carrot, the 25 consolidation process (proportionally) seems to have lagged behind other crops.

3.6. The impact of Consolidation on the Environmental Impacts and Pesticide Use
The result of an increase in acreage on PURE index values is shown in Table 3. The coefficient of acreage is significantly positive for surface water and pollinator and negative for soil and air. So, growers with more organic acreage are imposing more environmental impacts on surface water and pollinator, and less impacts on soil and air. Growers with more farming experience posed larger environmental impacts on soil and air.

Variations in the PURE index value is caused by changes in the pesticide applications. We start the analysis from evaluating the relationship between total pesticide use and organic acreage. Table 4 shows results.

The total AI used per acre and the total acreage treated per acre are not significantly correlated with farm organic acreage under most combinations of fixed effect. Therefore, the overall pesticide use, in terms of intensity and frequency, is not different across organic farms that vary in size. Notice here, the 
 is significant only when crop fixed effect is not included in the model, which reflects the fact that pesticide use patterns vary dramatically across crops.

Since the total pesticide use cannot explain the difference in environmental impacts found in Table 3. We need to focus on specific AIs/AI groups usage to see if organic farms with different size apply them differently. Microbials, sulfur, and fixed copper are three AIs/AI groups commonly used in organic crop production. The results of their usage are shown in Table 5.

Microbials are the most widely used pesticide category in organic agriculture. The number of applications per field and the application rate are not significantly correlated with organic acreage. The use of microbials did not vary across growers in different organic acreage size classes. The use of spinosad, azadirachtin, and pyrethrins is similar to that of microbials. For sulfur, the application rate and the number application are significantly correlated with our variable of interest. An increase in the organic acreage leads to an increase in the number of applications of sulfur and the use of sulfur per application. Overall, more sulfur and fixed copper are used per acre on farms with more organic acreage.

Sulfur serves as a protectant fungicide for powdery mildew. Fixed coppers are often used to treat plant diseases caused by the genus Xanthomonas such as bacterial leaf spot and leaf blight. Therefore, both AIs/AI groups must be applied preventatively and regularly to be effective (Schwartz and Otto, 1998; Hanna et al., 1997). The observation that growers with more organic acreage used sulfur more frequently is one of the theoretical predictions in Zilberman et al. (1991) where growers use pesticides as a tool to mitigate uncertainty in production.

AIs used in organic fields vary in their toxicities, which provide an explanation for findings in Table 3. For algae, the EC50 values are much larger for spinosad (6.1) and pyrethrins (320) than copper hydroxide (0.01), which is the most heavily applied AI in the fixed copper group (PPDB, 2020). So the increase in use of fixed coppers boosts the overall impact on surface water. Sulfur and Copper hydroxide are less toxic to earthworms, with LC50 values of 2000 and 677, respectively; spinosad and pyrethrins are moderately toxic to earthworm, with LC50 values of 458 and 24, respectively (PPDB, 2020). So, larger operations have less impact on soil by increasing sulfur and copper usage per acre. Sulfur products have zero VOC emissions as they do not sublimate or evaporate at ambient temperatures. The use of sulfur products reduces VOC emissions, which in turn leads to a decrease in the PURE air index value. For groundwater, the average index value is almost zero and there is not enough variation across fields to identify a significant impact of the acreage or experience variables. The impact on organic acreage on pollinators is significant but with a smaller magnitude for a similar reason.

As shown in the previous section, the crop composition has changed for organic agriculture in the past two decades. In particular, the acreage shares of vegetables increased. Therefore, we can replace the crop fixed effect with a dummy variable for vegetable crops to check if pesticide use differs significantly between vegetables and other crops. Results in Table 6 show that vegetables and other crops are treated the same in terms of total microbials, sulfur and fixed copper use per acre. Therefore, the rise in the acreage share of vegetable production does not contribute to our previous findings.

4. Robustness Check
This section presents estimation results under different settings to show that our findings are not due to a particular model selection or data processing method.

4.1. Results Under Different Organic Criteria
The first set of robustness check focuses on different criteria of identifying organic fields in the PUR database. As mentioned in Section 2.2, we categorize fields treated by only organic allowed AIs for three years as organic and assume fields with missing pesticide records are fallow, which is not accurate under certain circumstances such as the site location id has changed or inert ingredients in the pesticide product is not allowed to use in organic agriculture.

To address the changing site location id issue, we propose to assume missing pesticide records as conventional production instead of fallow. So, we categorize fields as organic only if we know what pesticides were applied in the past three years, which is a conservative approach and tends to miss all newly established organic cropland and organic cropland that has been transferred between growers. As for inert ingredients that can be prohibited to use in organic agriculture, we categorize fields using pesticide product information instead of AIs, which is also conservative because our list of organic allowed product is not complete. Details of the product list are discussed in appendix A. Eq. 1 is estimated for two sub-samples and presented in Table 7, Table 8.

When looking at samples with complete three years of organic allowed pesticide application records, fields just entering the organic sector are omitted until they have been in the PUR database for three years. This is equivalent to say that results in Table 7 shows how experienced organic growers apply pesticide.

In total, 50,515 field-year observations are categorized as organic in this sub-sample, which is about half of the size in our main analysis. This aligns with the fact that organic acreage has grew tremendously in California during our studying period. As shown in panel A of Table 7, organic farm acreage is not correlated with environmental impacts of pesticide use. Although key coefficients have the same sign as in the main analysis, they are no longer significant. Once we break down to sulfur and fixed copper usage (panel B in Table 7), growers with more organic acreage are not significantly different from others anymore. Meanwhile, the 
 in all models do not deviate from those from our main analysis, which means the explanatory power does not decrease.

At least two mechanisms are driving the result. First, pesticide application behaviors stabilized after three years of organic farming. When growers first adopted organic farming practices, they tried different pesticides, made mistakes, and gain experience. Once they are familiar with pest and weed issues, their pesticide use per acre remain unchanged when farm size changes. Second, variation of farm size is limited after three years organic farming. Because the grower fixed effect is included, variation of pesticide use is absorbed by the fixed effect if the farm size does not shift enough.

Table 8 shows results when we determine the organic status based on pesticide product use instead of AI use. In total, 81,514 fields-year observations are organic in this sub-sample, which is still less but close to the size of our main analysis. In the panel A of Table 8, only the PURE index of soil is significantly correlated with organic farm acreage, which aligns with our main results. Sulfur use per acre is positively correlated with organic farm acreage (panel B of Table 8), which is the same as before.

4.2. Results Under Different Combinations of Fixed Effects
The second set of robustness check is going to verify that our results are immune to the selection of fixed effects. As for environmental impacts, we focus our robustness check on soil and air, which are two significant aspects in the main analysis. The grower fixed effect is always included because this focus on how pesticide application behavior changes as growers changed their scale of production. When the crop fixed effect is omitted from the model, difference in pest pressure and pesticide portfolio across crops are going to be absorbed by variations in farm size. When the year fixed effect is not included, changes in weather and market conditions will be picked up by other variables in the model.

Results in the panel A of Table 9 show how environmental impacts are estimated under different model selections. Coefficients for PURE soil index are consistent with our main model. Coefficients for PURE air index are still align with previous results, listed in column 5, but no longer significant when the year fixed effect is missing. In the panel B of Table 9, sulfur and fixed copper usage per acre are significantly correlated with organic farm acreage under all fixed effect combinations and the magnitude of coefficients remains stable as well. Therefore, our previous findings that pesticide use and environmental impacts are correlated with organic farm size still hold.

5. Conclusions
The organic sector has been through a tremendous growth in the past three decades and is still expanding rapidly. Whether organic growers behave differently as the sector grows is a key question for the future of organic agriculture. This study provides insights by identifying organic fields from the PUR database using historical pesticide use records, evaluating environmental impacts of pesticide use in organic crop production, establishing the fact of consolidation of organic cropland, and quantifying the correlation between acreage expansion and pesticide use. Our method provides the basis for future studies to use the PUR database for the analysis of different aspects of organic agriculture in California.

We found that, from a spatial perspective, organic fields in California have expanded into new production regions over the past two decades, and the growth of organic acreage for fresh fruits and vegetables has been profound. For example, the organic kale acreage has exceeded conventional kale acreage in 2015. Organic growers' pesticide portfolio has changed dramatically during our study period. New AIs, such as spinosad and azadirachtin, were quickly adopted once approved for organic use and the shares of usage for sulfur and fixed copper, which were widely applied in earlier years, fell accordingly.

This study used the PURE index to assess the environmental impacts of organic crop production. We showed that pesticides used in organic agriculture have greater impacts on air and soil than on surface water, groundwater, and pollinators. There have been upward trends in the index values, particularly for the air and soil, which indicates that the changes which have occurred in the portfolio have environmental consequences, and previous assessments might have been too optimistic in generalizing the environmental performance of organic agriculture as the sector has grown dramatically.

Using the PUR database, we found that large farm operations increased their share of the total organic acreage, especially after the launch of NOP in 2001. The NOP was designed to convey a reliable signal to consumers that distinguishes organic produce from conventional. Consumers are willing to pay more for organic products, so producers have more incentive to expand their organic production. However, not all crops have followed the consolidation trend. Carrots and rice have a decrease in median farm acreage because smaller operations entered organic production.

The process of cropland consolidation is correlated with shifts in the pesticide portfolio, which alters the environmental impact of organic agriculture. Namely, growers with larger organic farm size applied more sulfur and fixed copper per acre, which increases the environmental impact on surface water and pollinator and decreases the impact on soil and air due difference in toxicities and VOC emissions.

Changes in the crop composition are observed in organic agriculture in California. The acreage shares of vegetables increased while the share of grapes and field crops decreased. However, the shift in crop mix does not alter our result that the consolidation affects pesticide uses and environmental impacts because this pattern does not change significantly across crops.

Primarily due to the lack of field-level data, previous studies focused less on the variation within the organic agriculture sector. Instead, the average performance across numerous organic growers was compared with other farming systems to illustrate the benefit from organic farming practices. The recent trend of cropland consolidation into larger operations has raised the question of how large organic farms behave differently from small ones, and what impacts those differences might have.

Our results partially answer this question in terms of pesticide use and show that as the organic cropland acreage increased, growers have changed their pesticide portfolios and associated environmental impacts. As observed in the conventional agriculture, the cropland consolidation process is inevitable (MacDonald et al., 2018). Therefore, new policy tools might be necessary to address the usage of pesticides in organic agriculture. The change in farm size could also alter practices other than pest management, such as fertilizer use. Future studies are needed to deliver a comprehensive analysis on the effect of consolidation on the overall environmental of organic agriculture.

As has long been the case for conventional agriculture, organic agriculture is increasingly characterized by the consolidation of production into the hands of larger operations. Using historical pesticide applications records from the California Pesticide Use Report (PUR), this study identified individual organic fields, to document the occurrence of cropland consolidation, and assess the correlation between cropland consolidation and pesticide use. Our results show that pesticide use is correlated with the consolidation of organic cropland. Farms with more organic acreage applied sulfur and fixed copper pesticides more frequently after controlled for the crop type and field size. As the result, larger farms had greater environmental impacts on surface water and smaller impacts on soil and air because sulfur and fixed copper are more toxic to fish and algae, and less toxic to earthworms and have lower Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions than other pesticides used in organic fields.

1. Introduction
Organic agriculture is often proposed as an essential part of sustainable food systems (Muller et al., 2017). Existing studies have evaluated the environmental performance of organic agriculture as a system and compared it with conventional agriculture from many aspects (Gomiero et al., 2011; Hartmann et al., 2015; Pimentel et al., 2005; Tuomisto et al., 2012; Seufert and Ramankutty, 2017).

Consumers often associate organic agriculture with small farms and diverse crop production (Adams and Salois, 2010), which might not be true anymore for organic agriculture in California because the consolidation process had been clearly documented for the organic food processing sector (Howard, 2009) and the U.S. agriculture in general (MacDonald et al., 2018).

Pesticide pressures and pesticide use are found to be correlated with farm size and field size (Wu et al., 2018; Rosenheim et al., 2022). If large organic farms apply pesticides differently from small ones, the consolidation into larger operations could undermine the perception of organic agriculture as environmentally friendly and hinder the development of organic agriculture.

Most pesticide products used in organic agriculture are generally less toxic than their conventional counterparts, but their reduced efficacy could drive higher application rates, which makes the overall environmental impact of organic agriculture less obvious. Meanwhile, certain pesticides used in organic agriculture have been found to be more toxic than conventional pesticides targeting the same pest (Biondi et al., 2012; Bahlai et al., 2010). Pesticide use in organic agriculture required special focus because study has shown that pesticide use is mainly driven by the crop value (Rosenheim et al., 2020).

Few studies have investigated the pesticide use patterns for organic fields and their environmental impacts. (Larsen et al., 2021) showed that organic fields are 30% more likely to not be sprayed by any pesticide compared to conventional fields. But, their study limited to productions only in the Kern county, where carrots accounted for 25% of the organic acreage. Therefore, more evidence is needed to: (1) quantitatively describe pesticide use in organic agriculture; (2) assess its environmental impacts for ecosystems on a large scale across numerous crops over a long time period; (3) and identify their relation with changes in farm size.

This study focus on how large organic farms apply pesticides differently, which also contributes to the large body of literature on farm size issues that started as least from (Sen, 1962). Researchers have found that farming practices involving labor, output price, and technology adoption vary significantly across farms with different sizes (Feder, 1985; Barrett, 1996; Fan and Chan-Kang, 2005; Rada and Fuglie, 2019). While previous studies emphasized on the economic outcomes such as productivity and poverty alleviation, our analysis focuses on the environmental impacts that resulted from changes in pesticide use, which helps us to understand more about the future of organic agriculture as the sector expanded.

In this study, we use California's Pesticide Use Report (PUR) database to identify individual organic fields, characterize pesticide use and cropland consolidation patterns, and assess the environmental impacts of pesticide use in California organic agriculture. California continues to be the leading state as a producer of organic crops in the United States, accounting for 12% of organic cropland and 50% of crop sales value (NASS USDA, 2020). California's unique Pesticide Use Report (PUR) database has very detailed and long-term data, which allows the identification of individual organic fields based on their historical pesticide use records. The PUR database contains information on all commercial agricultural pesticide use in California since 1995, including information on the chemicals used, crops and acreages for millions of individual applications. In total, >50,000 organic farms 120,000 organic fields were identified in the California from 1995 to 2015.

The PUR database has three merits in terms of studying organic agriculture. First, the organic crop production in California has a diverse crop portfolio which provides the opportunity to investigate how pesticide use and the consolidation process interact with changes in the crop mix. Fruits and vegetables received higher price premium compare to other organic produce (Carlson and Jaenicke, 2016), which creates different level of incentives for growers to adopt the organic production and apply pesticide. Secondly, the PUR database covers pesticide use information since 1995, which is 6 years before the launch of the National Organic Program (NOP). In Läpple and Van Rensburg (2011), the authors found that growers who entered organic production after the supporting policy was launched are more likely to be profit-driven and less environmentally concerned than growers who began organic production before any supporting policy was in place. The PUR database allows us to see the policy impact on pesticide use and cropland consolidation. Thirdly, the PUR database contains detailed location information, which is used by Zhan and Zhang (2012) to match with other geographic databases and calculate the environmental impacts on surface water, groundwater, soil, air, and pollinators from pesticide use. The environmental impact measure used in this study is more accurate and detailed than previous studies.

2. Data and Methods
In this section, we develop a method to identify organic fields and assess pesticide use in organic agriculture using the PUR database. Organic crop acreages identified from the PUR database are compared with data from other sources to discuss of our method. The Pesticide Use Risk Evaluation (PURE) index from (Zhan and Zhang, 2012) is used to evaluate the environmental impacts of pesticide usage. The impact of cropland consolidation on the pesticide use patterns and the environmental impacts of organic agriculture are quantified using the fixed-effect regression method.

2.1. The PUR Database on Pesticide Usage and Crop Fields
The main database used in this study is the PUR database, which contains detailed information on location, timing, amount and name of product applied, application methods, acreage treated, and crop treated. Since 1990, all agricultural pesticide use information in California has been collected by the County Agricultural Commissioners (CAC), who in turn, report it to the California Department of Pesticide Regulation (CDPR), which publishes the PUR database annually. The PUR database is the largest and most complete dataset on pesticide use in the world and it contains >3 million application records for agricultural use each year. Numerous studies in environmental science, plant pathology, and agricultural economics have been conducted based on the PUR database (Reynolds et al., 2005; Larsen et al., 2017; Davidson, 2004; Lybbert et al., 2016).

Non-chemical pest management practices, such as biological, cultural, and mechanical/physical controls, are not recorded in the PUR database. As a result, this study focuses only on the potential impacts posed by pesticide usage in organic agriculture. The PUR database from 1995 to 2017 were used in this study for two reasons. First, this time frame provides coverage before and after the launch of the National Organic Program (NOP) in 2001, which allows us to determine any effects of that policy change. Secondly, while the PUR database are available from 1990 onward, the data quality is known to be more variable in the early years (Wilhoit et al., 2001).

Pesticide use information in the PUR database is available at the field level. In this paper, a “field” is defined using two variables in the PUR database, “GROWER_ID” and “SITE_LOC_ID”. “GROWER_ID” is a number assigned to a grower or operator by CAC on their pesticide permit, and it remains constant for the same grower over time. “SITE_LOC_ID” is a code assigned by 5 CAC on the pesticide permit which indicates a particular location (field) where an application may occur. For a given field, this code may change from year to year, as it was assigned by growers, which creates some uncertainties in identifying organic fields across years. This uncertainty is accounted for in the analyses, as described below.

For each agricultural pesticide application, the PUR database specifies the location of application in the variable “COMTRS”, which stands for the county, meridian, township, range, and section as defined by the Public Lands Survey mapping system (PLSS). This information allows us to locate which section does the field belong and aggregate pesticide usage at the 1 × 1 mile PLSS section-level, which is the finest spatial scale reported in the PUR database. This detailed section-level analysis of the spatial distribution of organic fields in California and, how it has changed over time, is only possible using our method for identifying organic production fields in the PUR database.

In the PUR database, acreage information is recorded as both treated acreage and planted acreage. The former represents the acres physically treated in a pesticide application while the latter remains constant for the field within a year. However, previous experience with the PUR database by this research group has demonstrated that planted acreage is not consistently reliable for annual crops, so in this study, we use the maximum treated acreage in a given year as the acreage for each field for annual crops. This approach assumes that the entire field is treated with pesticide at least once per year. If this assumption is invalid, then the planted acreage will be under-counted. As presented below, the validity of this approach is supported by the consistency of state-scale crop acreages that are generated from the PUR database with those from other data sources.

One caveat of the PUR database for organic production is that since 2000, pesticide products deemed as having “minimum impacts” are no longer required to be registered with CDPR, which exempts them from the pesticide use reporting requirement. A detailed list of these pesticide ingredients can be found in the California Code of Regulations section 6147 (CDPR, 2000). 6 Most ingredients exempted from registration are natural or naturally-derived products (e.g., garlic oil), which could presumably be used in organic agriculture and have impacts on the surrounding environment. However, these exempted ingredients are not widely applied, based on their minimal amounts of usage in the PUR database prior to 2000 when they were still required to be reported. Therefore, this issue is not likely to invalidate our results, especially because the number of fields where only such ingredients were applied before 2000 is small.

For convenience, some chemically-related individual active ingredients (AIs) were grouped together, such as combining the many different strains of Bacillus thuringiensis, which target different insects and are each treated as a distinct AI in the PUR database, into a single “microbial” group. A detailed list of microbials is available in the appendix A. The group of “Copper, fixed” includes the summation of copper, copper oxychloride, copper octanoate, copper oxide, and copper hydroxide; and the two forms of copper sulfate (basic copper sulfate and copper sulfate pentahydrate).

2.2. Identifying Organic Fields from the PUR Database
Organic growers are required to comply with a set of crop management standards, regarding seeds and planting stock practices, soil fertility and crop nutrient management, pest, weed, and disease management, and crop rotation among others (NOP, 2001). The most relevant requirement for this study is that there is a 36-month transition period between the last application of any prohibited substance under organic regulations and officially recognized organic production. Our field identification method relies on this requirement. First, we constructed a list of allowed and prohibited substances based on various sources (as described in the appendix A). Second, we checked each field in the PUR database to see which AIs were applied over the past three years. If there were no applications of any prohibited ingredients, then the field was considered organic as of that year. Organic growers who do not use any chemical tools at all to manage pests and weeds are missing from the PUR database entirely, and therefore not identified in this study. However, 7 based on acreage comparisons between the PUR database and other data sources, those growers appear to operate a very limited number of acres.

Theoretically, a field could comply with the pest, weed, and disease management standards of the NOP while violating other standards (such as applying synthetic fertilizers) and still not qualify for organic production. Because the PUR database only contains pesticide use information, our method cannot distinguish such fields from actual certified organic fields. On the other hand, growers could follow organic farming practices but choose not to certify their fields for various reasons. However, as mentioned above, the amounts of acreage in these categories must not be very substantial because our PUR-derived organic crop acreages agree with those from CAC compiled sources, suggesting that our method is valid.

One caveat of this method is the consistency of field information in the PUR database from year to year. As mentioned previously, the “SITE_LOCATION_ID” on pesticide permits, a number chosen by growers or assigned by county, indicates a physical field location, but the ID number may change from year to year. When that ID changes, which happens for various reasons including land transaction between growers, a new “field” appears in the PUR database, for which we do not have information on its historical (i.e., over the previous three years) pesticide applications. In this situation, we assume for annual crops that the land was fallow until a new “SITE_LOCATION_ID” was assigned. Sample cost studies have shown that it is not profitable to produce under the organic standard without earning an organic price premium (Holtz et al., 2016; McGourty et al., 2016; Abraben et al., 2017).

This assumption could overestimate the organic acreage when a conventional field is given a new id and the grower use only pesticide AIs that are allowed in organic agriculture. We will verify this assumption by counting the share of organic allowed AIs used within a field every year. If conventional fields are never treated by only organic allowed AIs, then we can distinguish fields under difference status by using one-year of pesticide use record, which supports our assumption. Pasture and rangeland have unique pest management practices and enormous acreage, but they are not covered in this study as they do not suit our primary purpose of evaluating the environmental impacts of pesticide use in organic crop fields.

One could suggest to identify organic fields from the PUR database based on what pesticide products were used instead of AIs. Currently, pesticide manufacturers could register their products with two agencies at various costs, the Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI) and the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA), and obtain a label to show that their products are allowed to use in organic agriculture. The merit of this approach is to identify organic fields more precisely because certain pesticide products contain inert ingredients that are prohibited in organic agriculture which are categorized incorrectly if we only focus on AIs. However, this merit is no longer significant if conventional growers always use AIs that are prohibited in organic agriculture, which will be checked as mentioned before.

There are two disadvantages of using pesticide products to identify organic fields in the PUR database. First, not all pesticide products allowed in organic agriculture are registered. This is a significant drawback because our analysis started from 1995 but the first OMRI list was published in 1998 and earliest registration record from WSDA was in 1999. In addition, for products such as dusting sulfur, information asymmetry is not an issue because farmers are certain that they are allowed in organic agriculture, which makes product registrations not profitable. Second, products registered with OMRI and WSDA cannot be easily matched with products used in the PUR database. Product names slightly vary across systems. For example, product Nu-Film® P is called “MILLER NU-FILM-P"" in the PUR database, “Miller™ Nu Film® P Spreader Sticker” in the OMRI list, and “Nu Film P"" in the WSDA list. Both OMRI and WSDA lists do not provide EPA registration numbers, which is also missing for some products in the PUR database. More details about two products list are discussed in the appendix A. The main analysis will be repeated for fields treated with organic allowed pesticide product for three years to show results under different organic identification methods.

2.3. Other Data Sources for Organic Acreage
To test the validity of our method for identifying organic fields, we compared organic acreages derived from the PUR database with those available in other data sources, primarily from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA). The acreage data in each source were collected using different approaches and therefore it is common to observe differences.

2.3.1. CDFA Organic Registration Data
The California Organic Products Act requires an annual registration of all organic producers, handlers, and processors, regardless of their annual sales. Producers report acreage and total sales, expected or actual, for each crop they grow organically. Data for 1998 to 2016 have been summarized to the state-crop level in previous studies (Klonsky and Richter, 2005a; Klonsky and Richter, 2005b; Klonsky and Richter, 2011; Klonsky and Healy, 2013; Wei et al., 2020). After 2018, the registration data was summarized at county-crop level for a limited number of crop categories (CDFA, 2020). An acreage comparison is made for 2019 in appendix A.

2.3.2. USDA Certification and Organic Survey Data
The USDA's Economic Research Service (ERS) collected acreage data for seven crops at the state level from USDA-accredited state and private organic certifiers between 2000 and 2011 (ERS, 2011). However, the data only cover seven crops/crop groups and certified organic growers (growers with less than $ 5000 annual organic sales are exempted from certification). Meanwhile, USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) conducted five organic surveys between 1995 and 2017, which gathered organic crop acreage at the state level. However, responses to those surveys were voluntary and the average response rate for California was 69% (NASS USDA, 2010; NASS USDA, 2016b; NASS USDA, 2016a; NASS USDA, 2017). Therefore, we used the NASS survey data only when the USDA ERS data series were not available to construct the crop acreage data series.

2.3.3. California Strawberry Commission (CSC) Survey Data
For strawberries, the CSC collects organic data through its annual survey (CSC, 2021). The CSC data provide other information in addition to acreage and total sales, such as strawberry varieties and harvest timing. The response rate for this survey is unknown, which limits our understanding of its data quality. All three of these data sources were aggregated by crop (for the limited number of crops they include) or county, and individual field-level data are not available publicly. This limitation underscores the value of the PUR database and our method for providing unique information regarding organic crop production in California over space and time.

2.4. Assessing Potential Environmental Impacts of Pesticide Use
For pesticide applications on the identified organic fields in the PUR database, the PURE index was used to assess the potential environmental impacts (Zhan and Zhang, 2012). The PURE index is calculated for five different environmental dimensions: surface water, groundwater, soil, air, and pollinators. Individual index values are normalized to range from 0 (negligible impact) to 100 (highest impact).

For surface water, groundwater, soil, and pollinators, index values are calculated based on predicted environmental concentrations and standard toxicity values for endpoint organisms. The toxicity is commonly measured by the half maximal effective concentration (EC50), which is the dissolved concentration (mg/L) needed for a response halfway between the baseline and maximum lethality. A larger EC50 is associated with a less toxic chemical.

For surface water, the PURE index value is determined mainly by toxicities of AIs to aquatic organisms. The PURE soil index value is estimated based specifically on the toxicity for earthworms, which is measured by the dose that is lethal to 50% of the test population (LC50). The PURE index value for air is determined by the level of Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions. PURE index values are not directly comparable across different environmental aspects because the endpoint organisms are not the same.

The PURE index values are calculated for each AI in each pesticide application for each field. These AI-level disaggregated index values are then summed at the field-level, within each environmental aspect, to provide an overall assessment.

The algorithm of the PURE index assumes fields are heterogeneous across sections and includes the PLSS-level environmental variables for calculation. For example, fields that locate in sections closer to the river will have a greater PURE index score regarding surface water comparing to fields locate in other section when holding everything else constant. This is a major advantage of the PURE index over other methods commonly used in the literature for assessing the environmental impacts of pesticide use, such as the Environmental Impact Quotient (Kovach et al., 1992) or the pesticide load (Möhring et al., 2021).

2.5. Consolidation of Organic Cropland and its Impact on Pesticide Use
The consolidation of cropland into larger operations has been a persistent phenomenon in conventional agriculture since the 1930s (Gardner, 2009; Hart et al., 2003; MacDonald et al., 2018). Changes in farm size, measured in acreage, may create environmental concerns due to the differing production practices in larger and smaller operations. The empirical strategy of this paper has three parts: (1) First, we will estimate the correlation between organic farm size and environmental impacts of pesticide use; (2) Then, we will discuss changes in the overall pesticide use behavior by focusing on the total pesticides used per acre and the total treated acreage per acre as organic farm size changes;(3) Finally, we will study the use of particular pesticide AIs, including total amount, intensity, and frequency, that differs in larger and smaller organic farms. Together, our empirical strategy aims to identify the effect of farm size on environmental impacts of pesticide use and links it to specific pesticide use behaviors that vary across farms with difference acreage. The overall effects of farm acreage on the environmental impacts is identified using the following regression model:
(1)
where 
 is the one of the PURE index values in field 
 at year 
. The variable of interest is 
, which represents the total organic acreage, measured in units of 1000 acres, operated by grower 
 who manages field 
 at year 
. The years of farming observed in the PUR database for grower 
 is 
. There are three fixed effects in this model: grower fixed effect 
, year fixed effect 
, and crop fixed effect 
. Eq. 1 is also use to estimate the correlation between farm size and the overall pesticide use, where 
 is the total pesticide used per acre and the total acreage treated per acre. Environmental variables such as rainfall are not included in the model because the PURE index values are calculated based on those environmental conditions.

The standard error is clustered at grower level which assumes the decision making process of pesticide application is correlated across fields that are managed by the same grower but independent across growers. This assumption is based on the fact that most pesticide products and certain pesticide application equipment and services can be shared across fields and crops. Researchers have found that the usage of pesticides and fertilizers is correlated between growers Conley and Udry (2010).

Including the fixed effects and the farming experience variable help to mitigate the bias caused by the existence of unobserved factors (and therefore omitted variables) that influence the outcomes of interest. The data collecting process of the PUR database is designed to keep growers' identity confidential, which poses obstacles for researches. We cannot not retrieve information such as gender, age, and perceptions of environmental issues, which are commonly used in studies focused on pesticide use or organic farming. One could conduct surveys personally and match the results with the PUR database as in Lybbert et al. (2016). However, that approach often times is restricted by funding limits and hard to provide a broad view of topic of interests. We add a grower fixed effect in the model, which captures grower-level characteristics that remain unchanged over time, such as gender. Since grower id contains county information in the PUR database, the grower fixed effect also serves as a county fixed effect which helps to absorb differences across counties.

Pesticide use is determined by pest population which varies from year to year due to temperature and precipitation changes. The farm size is governed by the equilibrium prices which also changes over time. The year fixed effect in the model will capture such co-movement so that it does not bias the estimation of 
. Farm acreage and pesticide portfolio are difference across crops. Field crops such as rice are generally cultivated at a large scale and require less pesticide comparing to fruit crops such as strawberries. The crop fixed effect included in the model ensures that our estimations reveal the correlation between farm size and pesticide use within crops. Together the grower, crop, and year fixed effects serve the same purpose of helping to mitigate the omitted variables bias. A robustness check is included to show estimation results under different combinations of fixed effects.

For a particular AI/AI group, the pesticide use behavior can be measured by two variables: (1) the frequency of pesticide applications and (2) the intensity of pesticide use in each application. The correlation between organic farm acreage and use of particular pesticide AIs is identified using the following regression model with the grower, year, and crop fixed effects:
(2)
where 
 is the total pesticide used per acre, the number of applications per field, and the application rate of AI/AI group 
 in field 
 at year 
. The application rate measures the use intensity, which is defined as the total pounds of pesticide used divided by the total treated acreage for each field and AI/AI group. For example, if the field is 2 acres and it is sprayed three times a year with 5 pounds of AI each time, then total AI used is 15 pounds, the total treated acreage 6 acres, and the application rate is 2.5. Together, the number of applications and the application rate capture the pesticide use behavior.

The correlation between organic farm size and different measures of pesticide use is conducted for fields treated with AIs allowed in organic agriculture for three years as well as one year. The same estimation is repeated for fields treated with pesticide products allowed in organic agriculture for three years. As a robustness check, results are compared for organic fields identified under difference criteria.

3. Results and Discussion
This section presents data on the organic fields identified from the PUR database along with acreage summary for the top organic crops. The comparisons of organic acreages reported in different data sources are made to examine the validity of our approach. The environmental impacts for pesticides used on organic fields are assessed using the PURE index. Finally, the trend of cropland consolidation is presented and the effect of consolidation on pesticide use and the environmental impacts are quantified.

3.1. Organic Fields Identified in the PUR Database
Fig. 1 maps organic fields identified from the PUR database for all crops. Each pixel represents a section with any organic acreage. They are color-coded based on the number of organic acres in that section. Organic fields were more widespread in 2017 (Fig. 2B) than in 1995 (Fig. 2A). The number of sections with organic cropland increased from 1451 to 3008. Also, there was a pronounced shift toward more organic acreage within sections. By definition, each section contains 640 acres of cropland at a maximum. In 1995, only 5% of sections had >100 acres of organic cropland, which increased to 18% in 2017. In particular, substantial growth 15 was observed in Monterey, Fresno, and Imperial counties (outlined in red). Monterey County has the most organic acreage and the greatest number of sections with organic fields, increasing from 54 sections in 1995 to 202 sections in 2017. The top five organic crops in Monterey (leaf lettuce, spinach, broccoli, strawberry, and celery) accounted for 73% of total organic acreage in 2017. As the leading county, Monterey had 47% of the state's organic lettuce and 61% of California's organic strawberry acreage in 2017. Details on total organic acreage, average farm size, and number of organic farms for each county are available in the appendix A.
"
,,"To valid our approach using AIs to identify organic fields in the PUR database, we count, for each field-year, the number AIs used and the number of organic allowed AIs used, which give us the share of organic allowed AIs in all AIs used. If the share equals to 1, all AIs used in that field are allowed in organic agriculture.

Fig. 2 shows that 40% of fields are located at the left end of the horizontal axis, which means none of the organic allowed AI was used in those fields. The pesticide AI portfolio is very different between conventional and organic fields, which makes AI an appropriate criterion to distinguish organic fields from conventional ones.

3.2. Organic Crop Acreage in the PUR Database
Table 1 shows organic acreage for the top 10 crops (ranked by organic acreage in 2015) during the 21-year period from 1995 to 2015 and the total crop acreage for both conventional and organic production in 2015. Eight of the ten crops are fruits and vegetables. The remaining two are rice and almonds. Overall, the total organic acreage of these crops grew from 46,884 acres in 1995 to 162,389 acres in 2015, an increase of more than threefold. The first two columns show that organic acreage remained relatively stable in the five years before the NOP was established in 2001. Acreages of most of these crops grew dramatically in the subsequent years.

Note: Total acreage includes all acreage defined as either organic or conventional.


Total acreage can be less informative than the acreage shares of organic production if one tries to infer the importance of organic production for various crops. The shares of organic acreage relative to total acreage, listed in the last column of Table 1, show a wide variation across crops. For wine grapes, processing tomatoes, rice, and almonds organic acreage accounted for <5% of total crop acreage, which aligns with the average value of 3.4% of cropland in California that is certified organic (NASS USDA, 2016a). Meanwhile, fresh fruits and vegetables have a much higher share of organic acreage. For carrots, leaf lettuce, and spinach, 25%, 11%, and 18% of acreage respectively was devoted to organic production (Table 1). Among crops not shown in Table 1, kale, blackberries, and blueberries also have large organic shares, where organic production accounted for 55%, 36%, and 25% of their total acreage, respectively, in 2015 (data not shown). This phenomenon can be explained by the economic motivations for organic growers. More acreage will be cultivated as organic if the price premium for organic products is substantial compared to the increase in costs, and fresh produce, such as salad mixes, has a higher organic price premium than other products (Carlson and Jaenicke, 2016).

3.3. Organic Acreage Comparisons
Measures of State-specific total organic acreage from different data sources are compared for all seven crops/crop groups available in the USDA organic certification and survey data (ERS, 2011) plus strawberries from the CSC survey data (CSC, 2021). Among these eight crops/crop groups, four of them are annual and the others are perennial crops. Their organic acreage is plotted in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 below."
,,"As mentioned previously, then data sources have different reporting requirements and discrepancies can be caused by a variety of reasons that apply to all crops. In the CDFA registration data, new organic growers report their expected acreage for the next year. If growers decide not to engage in that expected organic production, their registration records remain in the system, which could produce an inaccurate inflation in acreage data, especially for crops that went through a rapid growth of organic production. Growers with less than $5000 annual organic sales are required to register their production with CDFA but do not have to apply for organic certification. So their acreage might not be counted in USDA data. Both USDA and CDFA data relies on a set of well-defined organic standards and restrictive regulations, which did not exist before 2001.

For perennial crops, new registrations with CDFA or new certifications with USDA must include the documentation of orchards before they are fully established (i.e., before pesticides would be used). Therefore, we observe new orchards and vineyards in the USDA and CDFA data before they enter the PUR database. If growers adopt the organic pest management program but do not market their products as organic, their acreage is only covered in the PUR database, not the others.

Meanwhile, discrepancies in acreage are caused by crop specific reasons. For lettuce (Fig. 3B), USDA has consistently reported higher acreage values since 2004. In 2016, the lettuce acreage from the USDA organic survey is more than double the acreage from the CDFA registration data (NASS USDA, 2017). One reason could be potential double or multiple cropping of lettuce in one calendar year. When growers harvested lettuce multiple times from the same field, USDA reported the sum of acres for each harvest while CDFA asked for the size of the field. Our method accounts for this phenomenon by counting days between the first and last pesticide applications. Normally, both leaf and head lettuce require at most 130 days from planting to harvest in California (Smith et al., 2011; Turini et al., 2011). So if two pesticide applications occur >130 days apart for the same field, we assume that the lettuce was harvested twice and the acreage would be doubled. After this adjustment, the PUR database still falls short of the acreage documented in the USDA dataset but is in-between the other two sources since 2003. Before 2003, CDFA had more acreage than the other data series because the crop category “lettuce, salad mix”, which contains arugula, red/green mustard, and other crops (which are listed separately in the PUR database and the USDA data), used to be reported as lettuce.

For strawberries (Fig. 3C), the CSC data always show somewhat less acreage because their data are derived from surveys (rather than required reporting) and the survey response rate is not reported. For apples (Fig. 4A), the organic acreage is small compared other perennial crops, which amplifies the potential measurement errors.

All types of grapes (table, wine, and raisins), are combined in Fig. 4C. The PUR database reported more organic acreage consistently. Abraben et al. (2017) showed that organic labeling generates a meaningful price premium only for low-quality wine, while the price of high-quality wine is actually reduced by consumers' perception of the organic label. This marketing issue creates an incentive for growers to intentionally avoid certifying their organic production in higher end wine grape production. Therefore, we observe more grape acreage following the organic farming practices than certifying as organic.

For tree nuts (almond, chestnut, pecan, pistachio, and walnut), the PUR database reported less organic acreage than the USDA and CDFA sources with a narrowing gap in recent years (Fig. 4D). Tree nut acreage has gone through a tremendous growth phase in California during the past two decades, with almond acreage increasing from 595,000 in 2000 to 1,110,000 in 2015, the period when Fig. 1D indicates that the PUR database is missing large portions of organic acreage (CDFA, 2000; CDFA, 2015). Normally pesticide applications are not required for the first two years in a nut orchard (Duncan et al., 2019; Brar et al., 2015; Grant et al., 2017), which makes the PUR database less reliable for capturing new organic tree nut acreage.

While organic fields without any pesticide applications in a given year are missing from the PUR database, this appears to be only a minor limitation because organic acreage from the PUR database is not consistently smaller than that from the other two sources for all crops. This minor limitation is compensated by the major advantages of the PUR database, i.e., its fine spatial scale 21 and comprehensiveness in terms of all crops, years and counties being included.

3.4. The PURE Index Values
The PURE index values for organic fields are plotted in Fig. 5. The PURE index for air increased steadily from 1995 to 2015, at an average annual growth rate of 4%. Several factors probably contributed, related to overall application rates and the changes in the organic AI portfolio over the years. The PURE index for air is calculated by multiplying the AI application rate by its VOC emission potential, which is a physicochemical property related to its tendency to evaporate or sublimate into the surrounding air. During the study period, the average application rate across all pesticides for organic growers decreased from 9.1 lb./acre in 1995 to 2.9 lb./acre in 2015 in contrast to the increase in the value of the PURE air index. However, the pesticide portfolio changed significantly as organic growers diversified their pesticide AI options and relied less on sulfur products over time. Because dusting sulfur products have zero VOC emission, the increasing applications of virtually any other AIs would have contributed to a steady increase in the PURE index value for air.

Fig. 5"
,,"Management of organic cropland has shifted toward larger farm operations during our study period. The acreage shares of each size class remained relatively stable until 2001 when NOP introduced a national standard for organic crop production and established the foundation of the organic price premium by protecting the integrity of the “organic” distinction (Fig. 6). However, in later years the share of organic acreage operated by farms in larger acreage classes rose. For example, in 2015, 56% of organic cropland was operated by growers with at least 500 acres of organic cropland, up from 15% in 1995. At the other end of the spectrum, growers with 10–50 acres accounted for 18% of organic cropland in 1995, which dropped to 8% in 2015."
,,"As mentioned previously, the observation that organic farms are getting larger could be driven by the change in crop mix instead of the consolidation process. To examine that, we plot the acreage share of each crop category in Fig. 7. The acreage shares of vegetables increased tremendously, from 30% in 1995 to 50% in 2015, while the acreage of grapes and field crops fell. Given that vegetables, such as lettuce and spinach, are produced at a smaller acreage scale than field crops, such as rice, the consolidation process in organic agriculture is profound as shown in the PUR database."
,,"Median crop acreage per grower is another common measure of farm size (MacDonald et al., 2018). By definition, half of growers operate less cropland than the median acreage value, while the other half operate more. Therefore, the median is a more meaningful statistic than the average because it not as sensitive to changes at the extremes. Acreages are not comparable across crops as the revenue per acre varies greatly. However, for any given crop, the change of median acreage over time reveals cropland shifts. Table 2 shows the median crop acreage per grower for the top 10 organic crops."
,,"Although larger farms continued to add cropland during the study period overall, such consolidation is not a universal pattern for all crops. Table 2 shows that by 2015, two out of ten crops actually had a decrease in median acreage per grower compared to 1995. Spinach growers had the most growth in median acreage, from 2 to 70 acres. Leaf lettuce production also consolidated with the median farm size increasing by 35 acres. The last row of Table 2 reports the median of total organic acreage per farm.

For crops with a lower organic price premium, growers lack the incentive to expand production. Therefore, it is not surprising to see that median acreage decreased for rice. Carrot has gone through the most significant growth of total organic acreage over the past two decades (Table 1). However, as small farms have continued to join in the production of organic carrot, the 25 consolidation process (proportionally) seems to have lagged behind other crops.

3.6. The impact of Consolidation on the Environmental Impacts and Pesticide Use
The result of an increase in acreage on PURE index values is shown in Table 3. The coefficient of acreage is significantly positive for surface water and pollinator and negative for soil and air. So, growers with more organic acreage are imposing more environmental impacts on surface water and pollinator, and less impacts on soil and air. Growers with more farming experience posed larger environmental impacts on soil and air."
,,"The total AI used per acre and the total acreage treated per acre are not significantly correlated with farm organic acreage under most combinations of fixed effect. Therefore, the overall pesticide use, in terms of intensity and frequency, is not different across organic farms that vary in size. Notice here, the 
 is significant only when crop fixed effect is not included in the model, which reflects the fact that pesticide use patterns vary dramatically across crops.

Since the total pesticide use cannot explain the difference in environmental impacts found in Table 3. We need to focus on specific AIs/AI groups usage to see if organic farms with different size apply them differently. Microbials, sulfur, and fixed copper are three AIs/AI groups commonly used in organic crop production. The results of their usage are shown in Table 5."
,,"Microbials are the most widely used pesticide category in organic agriculture. The number of applications per field and the application rate are not significantly correlated with organic acreage. The use of microbials did not vary across growers in different organic acreage size classes. The use of spinosad, azadirachtin, and pyrethrins is similar to that of microbials. For sulfur, the application rate and the number application are significantly correlated with our variable of interest. An increase in the organic acreage leads to an increase in the number of applications of sulfur and the use of sulfur per application. Overall, more sulfur and fixed copper are used per acre on farms with more organic acreage.

Sulfur serves as a protectant fungicide for powdery mildew. Fixed coppers are often used to treat plant diseases caused by the genus Xanthomonas such as bacterial leaf spot and leaf blight. Therefore, both AIs/AI groups must be applied preventatively and regularly to be effective (Schwartz and Otto, 1998; Hanna et al., 1997). The observation that growers with more organic acreage used sulfur more frequently is one of the theoretical predictions in Zilberman et al. (1991) where growers use pesticides as a tool to mitigate uncertainty in production.

AIs used in organic fields vary in their toxicities, which provide an explanation for findings in Table 3. For algae, the EC50 values are much larger for spinosad (6.1) and pyrethrins (320) than copper hydroxide (0.01), which is the most heavily applied AI in the fixed copper group (PPDB, 2020). So the increase in use of fixed coppers boosts the overall impact on surface water. Sulfur and Copper hydroxide are less toxic to earthworms, with LC50 values of 2000 and 677, respectively; spinosad and pyrethrins are moderately toxic to earthworm, with LC50 values of 458 and 24, respectively (PPDB, 2020). So, larger operations have less impact on soil by increasing sulfur and copper usage per acre. Sulfur products have zero VOC emissions as they do not sublimate or evaporate at ambient temperatures. The use of sulfur products reduces VOC emissions, which in turn leads to a decrease in the PURE air index value. For groundwater, the average index value is almost zero and there is not enough variation across fields to identify a significant impact of the acreage or experience variables. The impact on organic acreage on pollinators is significant but with a smaller magnitude for a similar reason.

As shown in the previous section, the crop composition has changed for organic agriculture in the past two decades. In particular, the acreage shares of vegetables increased. Therefore, we can replace the crop fixed effect with a dummy variable for vegetable crops to check if pesticide use differs significantly between vegetables and other crops. Results in Table 6 show that vegetables and other crops are treated the same in terms of total microbials, sulfur and fixed copper use per acre. Therefore, the rise in the acreage share of vegetable production does not contribute to our previous findings."
,,"4. Robustness Check
This section presents estimation results under different settings to show that our findings are not due to a particular model selection or data processing method.

4.1. Results Under Different Organic Criteria
The first set of robustness check focuses on different criteria of identifying organic fields in the PUR database. As mentioned in Section 2.2, we categorize fields treated by only organic allowed AIs for three years as organic and assume fields with missing pesticide records are fallow, which is not accurate under certain circumstances such as the site location id has changed or inert ingredients in the pesticide product is not allowed to use in organic agriculture.

To address the changing site location id issue, we propose to assume missing pesticide records as conventional production instead of fallow. So, we categorize fields as organic only if we know what pesticides were applied in the past three years, which is a conservative approach and tends to miss all newly established organic cropland and organic cropland that has been transferred between growers. As for inert ingredients that can be prohibited to use in organic agriculture, we categorize fields using pesticide product information instead of AIs, which is also conservative because our list of organic allowed product is not complete. Details of the product list are discussed in appendix A. Eq. 1 is estimated for two sub-samples and presented in Table 7, Table 8."
,,"When looking at samples with complete three years of organic allowed pesticide application records, fields just entering the organic sector are omitted until they have been in the PUR database for three years. This is equivalent to say that results in Table 7 shows how experienced organic growers apply pesticide.

In total, 50,515 field-year observations are categorized as organic in this sub-sample, which is about half of the size in our main analysis. This aligns with the fact that organic acreage has grew tremendously in California during our studying period. As shown in panel A of Table 7, organic farm acreage is not correlated with environmental impacts of pesticide use. Although key coefficients have the same sign as in the main analysis, they are no longer significant. Once we break down to sulfur and fixed copper usage (panel B in Table 7), growers with more organic acreage are not significantly different from others anymore. Meanwhile, the 
 in all models do not deviate from those from our main analysis, which means the explanatory power does not decrease.

At least two mechanisms are driving the result. First, pesticide application behaviors stabilized after three years of organic farming. When growers first adopted organic farming practices, they tried different pesticides, made mistakes, and gain experience. Once they are familiar with pest and weed issues, their pesticide use per acre remain unchanged when farm size changes. Second, variation of farm size is limited after three years organic farming. Because the grower fixed effect is included, variation of pesticide use is absorbed by the fixed effect if the farm size does not shift enough.

Table 8 shows results when we determine the organic status based on pesticide product use instead of AI use. In total, 81,514 fields-year observations are organic in this sub-sample, which is still less but close to the size of our main analysis. In the panel A of Table 8, only the PURE index of soil is significantly correlated with organic farm acreage, which aligns with our main results. Sulfur use per acre is positively correlated with organic farm acreage (panel B of Table 8), which is the same as before.

4.2. Results Under Different Combinations of Fixed Effects
The second set of robustness check is going to verify that our results are immune to the selection of fixed effects. As for environmental impacts, we focus our robustness check on soil and air, which are two significant aspects in the main analysis. The grower fixed effect is always included because this focus on how pesticide application behavior changes as growers changed their scale of production. When the crop fixed effect is omitted from the model, difference in pest pressure and pesticide portfolio across crops are going to be absorbed by variations in farm size. When the year fixed effect is not included, changes in weather and market conditions will be picked up by other variables in the model.

Results in the panel A of Table 9 show how environmental impacts are estimated under different model selections. Coefficients for PURE soil index are consistent with our main model. Coefficients for PURE air index are still align with previous results, listed in column 5, but no longer significant when the year fixed effect is missing. In the panel B of Table 9, sulfur and fixed copper usage per acre are significantly correlated with organic farm acreage under all fixed effect combinations and the magnitude of coefficients remains stable as well. Therefore, our previous findings that pesticide use and environmental impacts are correlated with organic farm size still hold.

5. Conclusions
The organic sector has been through a tremendous growth in the past three decades and is still expanding rapidly. Whether organic growers behave differently as the sector grows is a key question for the future of organic agriculture. This study provides insights by identifying organic fields from the PUR database using historical pesticide use records, evaluating environmental impacts of pesticide use in organic crop production, establishing the fact of consolidation of organic cropland, and quantifying the correlation between acreage expansion and pesticide use. Our method provides the basis for future studies to use the PUR database for the analysis of different aspects of organic agriculture in California.

We found that, from a spatial perspective, organic fields in California have expanded into new production regions over the past two decades, and the growth of organic acreage for fresh fruits and vegetables has been profound. For example, the organic kale acreage has exceeded conventional kale acreage in 2015. Organic growers' pesticide portfolio has changed dramatically during our study period. New AIs, such as spinosad and azadirachtin, were quickly adopted once approved for organic use and the shares of usage for sulfur and fixed copper, which were widely applied in earlier years, fell accordingly.

This study used the PURE index to assess the environmental impacts of organic crop production. We showed that pesticides used in organic agriculture have greater impacts on air and soil than on surface water, groundwater, and pollinators. There have been upward trends in the index values, particularly for the air and soil, which indicates that the changes which have occurred in the portfolio have environmental consequences, and previous assessments might have been too optimistic in generalizing the environmental performance of organic agriculture as the sector has grown dramatically.

Using the PUR database, we found that large farm operations increased their share of the total organic acreage, especially after the launch of NOP in 2001. The NOP was designed to convey a reliable signal to consumers that distinguishes organic produce from conventional. Consumers are willing to pay more for organic products, so producers have more incentive to expand their organic production. However, not all crops have followed the consolidation trend. Carrots and rice have a decrease in median farm acreage because smaller operations entered organic production.

The process of cropland consolidation is correlated with shifts in the pesticide portfolio, which alters the environmental impact of organic agriculture. Namely, growers with larger organic farm size applied more sulfur and fixed copper per acre, which increases the environmental impact on surface water and pollinator and decreases the impact on soil and air due difference in toxicities and VOC emissions.

Changes in the crop composition are observed in organic agriculture in California. The acreage shares of vegetables increased while the share of grapes and field crops decreased. However, the shift in crop mix does not alter our result that the consolidation affects pesticide uses and environmental impacts because this pattern does not change significantly across crops.

Primarily due to the lack of field-level data, previous studies focused less on the variation within the organic agriculture sector. Instead, the average performance across numerous organic growers was compared with other farming systems to illustrate the benefit from organic farming practices. The recent trend of cropland consolidation into larger operations has raised the question of how large organic farms behave differently from small ones, and what impacts those differences might have.

Our results partially answer this question in terms of pesticide use and show that as the organic cropland acreage increased, growers have changed their pesticide portfolios and associated environmental impacts. As observed in the conventional agriculture, the cropland consolidation process is inevitable (MacDonald et al., 2018). Therefore, new policy tools might be necessary to address the usage of pesticides in organic agriculture. The change in farm size could also alter practices other than pest management, such as fertilizer use. Future studies are needed to deliver a comprehensive analysis on the effect of consolidation on the overall environmental of organic agriculture.

,,"ABSTRACT
The ecotoxicological hazard assessment of pesticide use on crops was performed. The study was conducted in 2021-2023 at the experimental field of the Skvyra Research Farm of the Institute of Agroecology and Environmental Management of National Academy of Agrarian Sciences of Ukraine, located in the Forest-Steppe zone of Ukraine. The influence of herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides on the formation of environmental hazards in crop agrocenoses was studied: experiment 1 - peas, winter wheat, buckwheat; experiment 2 - winter wheat, buckwheat, oats. The ecological risk was assessed taking into account the ecotoxic properties of the chemical active ingredients of pesticides. It was found that the main parameters characterizing the occurrence of environmental risks are: 1) the pesticide load, i.e. the amount of toxicant applied per unit of sown area; 2) the ecotoxicity of the pesticide (LD50), which is established by hygienic standards; 3) the persistence of the pesticide in the soil, namely, its half-life (DT50), etc. The calculations proved that the pesticides used had a low environmental risk of impact on agrocenoses. This is evidenced by the ecotoxicity index (E). The total pesticide load (ΣE) on the agrocenosis of each crop during the three years of the study (2021-2023) was calculated. It was found that in experiment 1 - ΣExperiment 1 = 0.23 conventional units (c.u.); in experiment 2 - ΣEexperiment 2 = 0.04 c.u. The results obtained indicate an insignificant environmental risk of pesticide use for experimental plots of crops of the studied farm. However, prolonged use of pesticides certainly leads to the concentration of their persistent residues in the soil. This can lead to contamination of crop products and environmental. The cereals (buckwheat and oats) grown on the farm are intended for dietary consumption. To confirm the reliability of the hypothesis of the safety of the obtained grain and cereal products, it is advisable to further study their quality in terms of pesticide residues. It is shown that this methodology can be used to assess the risk of pesticide contamination of an agroecosystem. The ecotoxicity criterion (E) can be considered as a management tool for reducing environmental risks in agroecosystems."
,,"Abstract
Bees carry out vital ecosystem services by pollinating both wild and economically important crop plants. However, while performing this function, bee pollinators may encounter potentially harmful xenobiotics in the environment such as pesticides (fungicides, herbicides and insecticides). Understanding the key factors that influence the toxicological outcomes of bee exposure to these chemicals, in isolation or combination, is essential to safeguard their health and the ecosystem services they provide. In this regard, recent work using toxicogenomic and phylogenetic approaches has begun to identify, at the molecular level, key determinants of pesticide sensitivity in bee pollinators. These include detoxification systems that convert pesticides to less toxic forms and key residues in insecticide target-sites that underlie species-specific insecticide selectivity. Here we review this emerging body of research and summarise the state of knowledge of the molecular determinants of pesticide sensitivity in bee pollinators. We identify gaps in our knowledge for future research and examine how an understanding of the genetic basis of bee sensitivity to pesticides can be leveraged to, a) predict and avoid negative bee-pesticide interactions and facilitate the future development of pest-selective bee-safe insecticides, and b) inform traditional effect assessment approaches in bee pesticide risk assessment and address issues of ecotoxicological concern."
,,"1. Introduction
Bees are a group of hymenopteran insects comprising approximately 20,000 described species (Michener, 2007). Bees are the world's most economically and environmentally important group of insect pollinators with 35 % of global food production dependent on their pollination services (Klein et al., 2007). Unfortunately, many bee species have been declining over recent decades threatening these essential ecosystem services (Potts et al., 2016; Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhuys, 2019; Wagner et al., 2021). The possible reasons for these declines are complex and include habitat loss, climate change, parasites and pathogens, and pesticides (Wagner et al., 2021). In the case of pesticides, as insects, bee species may be particularly vulnerable to insecticides, and certain insecticides (e.g. certain neonicotinoids) have been banned in Europe after a review of their risk to bee health by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) (Bass and Field, 2018). However, as a group, insecticides currently play a key role in controlling insect disease vectors and securing quality and yield in plant production, and will remain an important component of integrated pest and vector management programs in the future. Given this, to safeguard the health of bee pollinators, it is essential that we understand the key factors that influence the toxicological outcome of insect exposure to these chemicals.

While bees have only been exposed to human-made pesticides over the recent past (last 80 years) they have co-evolved with plants and fungi which produce a range of xenobiotics, including plant allelochemicals and mycotoxins. This has led to the evolution of sophisticated systems that allow bees to detoxify or circumvent the natural xenobiotics they encounter in their environment (Berenbaum and Johnson, 2015; Gong and Diao, 2017; Johnson, 2015). These systems may have the potential to be co-opted to protect bees from certain synthetic pesticides if there is sufficient structural similarity between natural and synthetic xenobiotics. This is made more likely by that fact that, many pesticides, such as the neonicotinoids and pyrethroids, are derivatives of natural plant allelochemicals (Casida and Durkin, 2013).

Interestingly, recent work has shown that bees can exhibit profound variation in their sensitivity to different insecticides – including to compounds belonging to the same class (Beadle et al., 2019; Iwasa et al., 2004; Manjon et al., 2018; Reid et al., 2020) (Fig. 1). For example, honeybees (Apis mellifera) are >1000-fold less sensitive to the neonicotinoid thiacloprid than the neonicotinoid imidacloprid in acute contact bioassays (Iwasa et al., 2004) with the former classified as ‘highly toxic’ but the latter categorised as ‘practically non-toxic’ according to the official categories of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA et al., 2014). In another example, while many pyrethroid insecticides are highly toxic to insect pollinators, others, such as tau-fluvalinate, display such low acute toxicity to bees that they are used as in-hive treatments by beekeepers against parasitic Varroa mites (Mao et al., 2011). In contrast, the leaf-cutting bee Megachile rotundata is highly sensitive to many insecticides tested so far, including compounds categorised as moderately and practically non-toxic to honeybees, such as the cyano-substituted neonicotinoid insecticides acetamiprid and thiacloprid and the synthetic pyrethroid insecticide tau-fluvalinate. Why are some bees highly tolerant to some insecticides but not others, and what are the specific mechanisms that underpin this differential sensitivity? Recent toxicogenomic work has begun to address this question and identify the key factors that determine pesticide sensitivity in bee pollinators. In this review we summarise the current state of knowledge on this topic. We frame our review by addressing two primary questions: What are the molecular determinants of pesticide sensitivity in bee pollinators? How can an understanding of these factors be leveraged to predict and avoid negative bee-pesticide interactions, and inform bee pollinator pesticide risk assessment?

2. Mechanisms
A variety of different mechanisms have been implicated in the tolerance of bees to specific pesticides, and thus as determinants of insecticide sensitivity, these include metabolic detoxification, insecticide target proteins, the insect cuticle and bee gut microbiota. These mechanisms are illustrated in Fig. 2 and described in detail below."

In this approach knowledge of the molecular determinants of pesticide selectivity in model bee species is leveraged, in combination with genomic data for non-model species) to predict the sensitivity of non-model species to a pesticide of interest. A range of in silico approaches can be used to establish if non-model bee species have key sensitivity determinants present in the model species (such as CYP9Q-type P450s). These include: (A) phylogenetic and syntenic analysis, (B) determination of insecticide specificity from multiple sequence alignments (MSA), and, (C) three-dimensional modelling of protein structure. In concert with this genomic framework, there is a requirement for tools which can be used to provide experimental support and validation to in silico predictions. These include: (D) in vitro tools in the form of purified recombinant bee P450 enzymes that can be used to measure P450 activity (and pesticide-mediated inhibition of this activity) in simple fluorescent assays (using fluorescent model substrates) or analytical assays based on by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and, (E) transgenic fruit fly (D. melanogaster) lines each engineered to express CYP9Q-type P450s of different bee species.

In concert with this genomic framework, there is a requirement for tools which can be used to provide experimental support and validation to in silico predictions and enable the reliable identification of essential molecular determinants of pesticide selectivity. In the case of P450 enzymes, two complementary systems that facilitate functional validation of pesticide interactions with key protective P450s of bees have been developed. The first of these comprise in vitro tools in the form of purified recombinant bee P450 enzymes and associated fluorescent model substrates that can be used to measure P450 activity in simple fluorescent assays (Haas and Nauen, 2021). Together the enzymes and model substrates can be used in high-throughput screens of pesticides to examine if the P450 of interest is interacting with the test compound (providing an indication of its potential to be metabolised by P450s or inhibit P450 function). Such an approach would have parallels with molecular medicine approaches used to characterize P450–drug interactions in the pharmaceutical industry in order to predict impacts on human physiology and health (López-Osorio and Wurm, 2020). The utility of this approach was recently demonstrated in a study revealing certain fungicides as strong inhibitors of honeybee CYP9Q P450 enzymes - providing a molecular explanation as to why such fungicides can dramatically increase bee sensitivity to selected insecticides (Haas and Nauen, 2021). This serves as a demonstration of how such tools can be used to identify pesticide combinations that are harmful to bees. In vivo tools have also been developed that can be used to test in silico predictions of bee sensitivity to pesticides. An example of these are transgenic fruit fly (D. melanogaster) lines each engineered to express CYP9Q-type P450s of different managed bee species (Beadle et al., 2019; Manjon et al., 2018; McLeman et al., 2020). These genetically modified Drosophila lines are now resistant to the same pesticides as the native bee species, and their sensitivity to novel pesticides, or pesticide combinations, can be examined using simple pesticide bioassays. The ectopic expression of P450s in Drosophila provides information on the phenotype a P450 gene of interest confers (e.g. level of tolerance, cross-tolerance profile etc.). This system thus provides a useful complement to in vitro assays which provide information on enzyme catalytic activity but not the phenotypic level of tolerance a P450 confers (McLeman et al., 2020). Similarly, advances enabling the genomic manipulation of honeybees, e.g. via the CRISPR/Cas9 system provide a promising tool to study the impact of individual genes or genetic variation on pesticide sensitivity in the future (Chen et al., 2021; Grozinger and Zayed, 2020).

While in silico-based methods for predicting bee sensitivity to insecticides will not replace conventional toxicity trials, such an approach will significantly aid decisions on which species should be prioritized for toxicity testing, while also informing pesticide risk assessment in taxa that are not readily accessible for acute toxicity testing. Furthermore, integration of these approaches within the Aggregate Exposure Pathway (AEP) and Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) conceptual frameworks could be used to anchor the findings within a broader context (Teeguarden et al., 2016; Vinken et al., 2017). This would provide understanding of how insecticide detoxification by bee P450s relates to other factors leading from insecticide exposure to an eventual adverse outcome endpoint. Longer term, as predictions on the sensitivity of bees to pesticides made using genomic data are refined through ongoing functional validation, it may be possible to move towards more automated approaches. An example of such an approach is the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Sequence Alignment to Predict Across Species Susceptibility tool (SeqAPASS v6.0; https://seqapass.epa.gov/seqapass/), which extrapolates chemical toxicity knowledge across species through the evaluation of conserved protein sequence and structure (LaLone et al., 2016). Similarly, the SPDlight algorithm uses the specificity-determining positions (SDP) prediction method to determine the functional specificity of proteins with a common general function (Kalinina, 2004). This approach does not rely on any information about the protein family except its multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and specificity of some members of the family.

Finally, the identification of the molecular determinants of insecticide metabolism in bees also has potential to facilitate the rational design of future insecticides by informing structure-based design. In addition, the functional tools detailed above provide a filtering tool to examine the metabolic liability of future lead compounds to understand it they are likely to be rapidly metabolised by P450s of beneficial insects. This is of high value as live bioassays on beneficial insects such as bees are expensive and time-consuming to perform, with many species only available for a few months of the year (McLeman et al., 2020).

3.2. Knowledge gaps for future research
The literature highlighted in this review reveal the dramatic advances made in our understanding of the molecular determinants of bee sensitivity to pesticides over the last 5-10 years. However, the research conducted on this topic has inevitably led to a range of questions for further research. While it is not possible to list all of these, here we describe some of the knowledge gaps, which, in our view, are priorities for future research.

Firstly, our understanding and resolution of the full spectrum of genetic factors influencing bee sensitivity to pesticides, and their relative contribution to phenotype, remains limited. For example, while the role of P450 genes as insecticide sensitivity determinants is now well established, the role, if any, of other detoxification genes, such as esterases, glutathione S-transferases, UDP-glucosyltransferases and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters remains largely unknown. In this regard, recent comprehensive RNAseq analyses of the expression profile of the entire detoxification gene inventory of honeybees may assist with the selection of candidate genes for further analyses (Maiwald et al., 2023). Related to this, several studies have revealed marked variation in the expression of molecular determinants of insecticide sensitivity in different bee life stages and after exposure to different environmental xenobiotics (Maiwald et al., 2023; Mao et al., 2013; Mao et al., 2011) and the impact of this on bee sensitivity requires further exploration. In this regard the finding that p-coumaric acid exposure can enhance metabolism of insecticides in honeybees by inducing CYP9Q3 expression (Mao et al., 2013) could be investigated in future as a potential means to enhance intrinsic pesticide tolerance of bees. In terms of factors that are not encoded by bee genomes, the role of the bee microbiome on pesticide sensitivity in vivo remains uncertain and warrants further investigation, including research into variation in the microbiome between bee populations/species. Furthermore, while some progress has been made in identifying structure-function determinants of insecticide binding/metabolism at the amino acid level (Haas et al., 2023; Tsvetkov et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2017), further work is required to enhance our resolution of insecticide-bee protein interactions.

Secondly, while genomic data have been effectively leveraged to understand inter-specific variation in key insecticide sensitivity determining genes of bees, knowledge of the extent of intra-specific variation in these genes and its impact on phenotype remains poor. However, efforts to sequence insect populations and new approaches that consider the genetic variation of a species as represented by its pangenome will facilitate investigation of this topic (Dogantzis and Zayed, 2019; Sherman and Salzberg, 2020).

Thirdly, future research needs to address how different insecticide sensitivity determinants contribute to phenotype in combination (e.g. are interactions additive, synergistic or epistatic). Such knowledge is important as it facilitates the development of increasingly sophisticated, and accurate, risk assessment frameworks in the future.

Finally, bees are exceptionally diverse in their ecology and life history. The expanding data available on the ability of these species to detoxify or circumvent natural and synthetic insecticides offers an excellent opportunity to understand the ecological factors influencing the evolution of xenobiotic detoxification genes in one of the most diverse and ecologically important group of insects on the planet.

The escalating use of pesticides in agriculture for enhanced crop productivity threatens aquatic ecosystems, jeopardizing environmental integrity and human well-being. Pesticides infiltrate water bodies through runoff, chemical spills, and leachate, adversely affecting algae, vital primary producers in marine ecosystems. The repercussions cascade through higher trophic levels, underscoring the need for a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between pesticides, algae, and the broader ecosystem. Algae, susceptible to pesticides via spillage, runoff, and drift, experience disruptions in community structure and function, with certain species metabolizing and bioaccumulating these contaminants. The toxicological mechanisms vary based on the specific pesticide and algal species involved, particularly evident in herbicides' interference with photosynthetic activity in algae. Despite advancements, gaps persist in comprehending the precise toxic effects and mechanisms affecting algae and non-target species. This review consolidates information on the exposure and toxicity of diverse pesticides and herbicides to aquatic algae, elucidating underlying mechanisms. An emphasis is placed on the complex interactions between pesticides/herbicides, nutrient content, and their toxic effects on algae and microbial species. The variability in the harmful impact of a single pesticide across different algae species underscores the necessity for further research. A holistic approach considering these interactions is imperative to enhance predictions of pesticide effects in marine ecosystems. Continued research in this realm is crucial for a nuanced understanding of the repercussions of pesticides and herbicides on aquatic ecosystems, mainly algae."
,,"1. Introduction
The increasing usage of pesticides and herbicides in contemporary agriculture has raised serious concerns because of the possible harm they may cause to aquatic environments. These chemicals severely threaten the fragile balance of marine environments because they enter aquatic bodies through runoff, chemical spills, and leachate (Rajak et al., 2023). Because they are crucial primary producers in aquatic ecosystems, algae are especially vulnerable to the negative impacts of pesticides, and their deteriorated health can have a domino effect on higher trophic levels. This thorough analysis provides insight into the complex interactions between algal communities and pesticides/herbicides and the various ecological effects (Bastviken et al., 2023). When algae are subjected to pesticides through several channels, like spills, runoff, and drift, their community structure and functioning functions are disturbed. Certain species are affected because they metabolize these chemical pollutants and accumulate them in their bodies, which intensifies their effects on the ecosystem as a whole (Dhanker et al., 2023). The toxicological mechanisms display significant heterogeneity contingent on the particular chemical and algae species. Interestingly, herbicides are potent inhibitors of algae photosynthetic activity, complicating our understanding of their ecological effects (Kumar et al., 2023). Critical gaps still need to be in our understanding of the harmful effects and mechanisms governing the interaction between pesticides and algae, as well as the unintentional consequences they have on non-target species, despite substantial advancements in research. To shed light on the underlying mechanisms at work, this study aims to compile and evaluate the body of research currently available regarding the exposure to and toxicity of a wide variety of pesticides and herbicides to aquatic algae (Thanigaivel et al., 2024). The complex interactions between nutrient content, pesticides, and herbicides and their combined effects on algae and related microbial species will be given particular attention (Sarker et al., 2024). The observed variation in a single pesticide's detrimental effects amongst different species of algae highlights the need for additional research to develop a more comprehensive knowledge. This review seeks to improve predictions about pesticide impacts in marine ecosystems by taking a comprehensive approach and considering these complex interactions. Understanding how these interactions interact is essential for making well-informed decisions and creating sustainable farming methods that lessen the unexpected effects of pesticide use (Barathi et al., 2024). This study highlights the critical need for more research to improve our understanding of the far-reaching effects of pesticides and herbicides on aquatic ecosystems, mainly algae, as we delve into the complex interactions between pesticides, algae, and the larger aquatic ecosystem. A more comprehensive approach is needed to address the changing issues in aquatic ecosystems as we navigate the intricacies of pesticide and herbicide impacts on algal communities (Wahab et al., 2023). The need for sustainable and environmentally conscious techniques is urgent since the growing demand for food production is driving the use of pesticides. Predicting the general health and resilience of aquatic ecosystems requires understanding the indirect effects on non-target species, such as fish, invertebrates, and microbial communities. Moreover, particular consideration should be given to how environmental variables like temperature, pH, and nutrient levels affect how pesticides and algae communities interact. Investigating these interactions in various ecological conditions can reveal information on how adaptable and susceptible algae species are to pesticide exposure (Machuca-Sepúlveda et al., 2023). The socioeconomic aspects of pesticide use also need to be taken into account A sophisticated strategy is needed to balance the requirement for greater agricultural productivity and the protection of aquatic ecosystems. Sustainable food production while reducing environmental impact requires the integration of ecological ideas into agricultural policies and practices (Agathokleous et al., 2023).

This extension stimulates more study and multidisciplinary cooperation amongst toxicologists, ecologists, agronomists, and legislators. To close knowledge gaps, a thorough grasp of the direct consequences of pesticides must be paired with an investigation of the more extensive ecological, environmental, and socioeconomic conditions. Our understanding of the interdependence of several elements affecting pesticide effects on algal communities opens the door to proactive conservation efforts and well-informed decision-making. Navigating the complex terrain of pesticide usage in agriculture and its consequences for the delicate balance of aquatic ecosystems requires ongoing research and a comprehensive approach.

2. Physico-chemical attributes of pesticides
Pesticides exhibit various physical and chemical properties that affect how they behave in the environment to manage pests and improve agricultural yields. A crucial component that affects mobility and possible leaching into groundwater or surface water discharge is pesticide solubility, which differs among them (Das et al., 2022). Highly volatile pesticides are transported through the atmosphere and contribute to air pollution due to their volatility, which reflects vaporization tendencies. The affinity of a pesticide for organic substances is shown by the Octanol-Water Partition Coefficient (Kow), which affects the potential for bioaccumulation in lipid-rich tissues and sediments (Concha-Graña et al., 2022). A pesticide's persistence—how long it remains in the environment before decomposing—is a significant factor in its long-term ecological hazards. The fate and toxicity of substances in the environment are further shaped by degradation routes such as photolysis, hydrolysis, and microbial degradation (Halevas et al., 2022). Different pesticide classes have different chemical structures, which define their modes of action and affect how they interact with both target and non-target organisms. Mobility is impacted by adsorption to soil particles, and high adsorption coefficients decrease leaching concerns. pH sensitivity influences the preferences, pesticide transformations, and bioavailability in various environments. Water repellence, or hydrophobicity, affects an organism's distribution in aquatic environments and interactions with other aquatic creatures (Hrynko et al., 2023). The composition, which includes carriers and adjuvants, influences stability and physical characteristics. A comprehensive comprehension of these characteristics is essential for evaluating the influence on the environment, creating efficient management plans, and advocating for environmentally friendly farming methods that reduce damage to ecosystems (Teklu et al., 2023). A thorough understanding of pesticide behavior is made possible by ongoing study in this area, which makes it easier to create ecologically friendly pest management plans. Table 1 summarized pesticide properties and highlighted sediment studies in background agricultural soils."
,,"2.1. Environmental half-lives and mobility of pesticides/herbicides
The half-life describes how long the time required for an identified quantity of pesticide or herbicide to be decreased in half. This happens when it degrades in the ecosystem. A pesticide will typically degrade to 50 % of its original concentration following 1 half-life. Following 2 half-lives, about 25 % remain (Fantke et al., 2014). Following 3 half-lives, approximately 12 % will continue to be present. This proceeds till the quantity left are almost zero. According to the surrounding circumstances, every pesticide or herbicide might exhibit multiple half-lives (Zaller, 2020). For instance, permethrin degrades at different rates in vegetation, water, soil, as well as dwellings. Permethrin's half-life in soil is approximately 40 days, with a range of 11–112 days. Permethrin has a half-life that ranges from 19 to 27 h in water. If this adheres to debris, it may persist for years. Permethrin's half-life on surfaces of plants varies between 1 and 3 weeks based on the sort of plant. Permethrin's half-life can vary significantly indoors. It is anticipated that it will last more than 20 days, if not longer (Elser et al., 2022).

A half-life can determine the degree to which or not a herbicide or pesticide accumulates in the soil and water. Pesticide lifespans can be divided into three groups for determining persistence (Caldas, 2019). They are classified as low (>16 days half-life), intermediate (16–59 days), as well as high (<60 days). Pesticides having a shorter half-life accumulate less since they're unable to remain in their surroundings. Pesticides having more prolonged half-lives, on the other hand, are prone to accumulate over time. This raises the possibility of polluting adjacent groundwater, surface water, vegetation, as well as animals (Tadeo et al., 2019). Nevertheless, pesticides with extremely brief half-life can have negative consequences. A single use of a pesticide that has a few-hour half-life is unlikely to be highly efficient for a while later. It's so because the product might have degraded to almost zero levels after just a few days. This kind of substance would most likely need to be administered repeatedly during those weeks. This may raise the potential hazards of exposure to humans, and non-target livestock, including plants (Tudi et al., 2021). The long-term stability of pyrazosulfuron-ethyl was examined under three humidity conditions. Pyrazosulfuron-ethyl retention in sediments follows first-order exponential breakdown kinetics, mostly affected by soil organic matter as well as moisture levels. The half-lives of pyrazosulfuronethyl in soil varied between 42.9 and 85.5 days (Sondhia, 2019). Chlorsulfuron degrades rapidly in low-pH soil and has a higher GR50 value compared to high-pH soil (Sondhia, 2019).

Metsulfuron-methyl half-life ranged from 6.3 to 17.5 days. Nevertheless, leftovers of metsulfuron-methyl paddy topsoil at thirty days were 0.008–0.016 µg g−1 with a rate of application of 2–8 g/ha(Paul et al., 2009). At harvesting, residue levels in soil, grains of rice, as well as straw were less than 0.001 µg g−1. Herbicide metabolites in agricultural products that exceed the permissible limit can be harmful to humans and animals. The final destination of herbicides in the soil is determined by a variety of steps, including volatilization, microbe degradation, leaching, chemical processes, photodecomposition, and runoff (Islam et al., 2018a).

3. Understanding the interplay between pesticides, algae, and ecosystems
Pesticides are essential for increasing agricultural yields but also quite dangerous for aquatic environments. Therefore, understanding how they interact with algae and larger ecosystems is essential. This section explores the nuanced interactions between these components, illuminating complicated mechanisms and their ecological implications (Vijayaraj et al., 2022). Herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides are among the pesticides used in agriculture to suppress pests, guarantee food security, and increase yields. Utilized in a variety of ways, including spraying and soil integration, these compounds are now widely used in contemporary agricultural techniques (Polazzo et al., 2022).

Pesticides can enter water bodies through many different routes. Pesticides from fields are carried by runoff from irrigation or rain, chemical spills during handling lead to direct contamination, and leaching permits pesticides to seep into the soil and eventually reach groundwater, contaminating aquatic environments(Ma et al., 2022). Algae are essential primary producers in aquatic habitats that contribute significantly to the food chain. Algal communities offer essential insights into the health of ecosystems because they are sensitive indicators of environmental changes. Algal species are essential players in cycling nutrients and energy transmission due to their diversity and ecological roles. Pesticide exposure can affect algal communities through direct contact with polluted water, indirect contact through contaminated prey, and interruption of photosynthesis, especially from herbicides (Peña et al., 2023). Algal growth, reproduction, and general community dynamics may be impacted by such exposure. Exposure to pesticides can cause changes in the dominance of algae species, which can impact higher trophic levels and have a domino effect on the aquatic food web. It is possible for biodiversity to disappear, reducing ecosystem stability and resistance to environmental alterations (Wu et al., 2022). Different algae may metabolize and detoxify poisons in different ways, affecting their susceptibility. Pesticides may bioaccumulate in algal tissues, which could result in biomagnification as the toxins climb the food chain and endanger higher trophic levels. Herbicides intended to attack the photosynthetic machinery disrupt algae's ability to produce chlorophyll and move electrons. The intricacy of these relationships is highlighted by the varied responses that various algae species exhibit to photosynthetic interference caused by herbicides (Feng et al., 2023).

4. Vulnerability of algal communities to pesticide exposure
As essential primary producers in marine environments, algal communities are particularly vulnerable to pesticide exposure. Pesticides seep into water bodies from urban areas, industrial operations, and agricultural runoff, exposing algal communities to direct contact with pesticide-contaminated waters (Vormeier et al., 2023). This exposure causes rapid physiological stress that impairs photosynthesis growth rates and, in extreme situations, results in death. Through trophic interactions, herbivores that eat pesticide-contaminated algae serve as conduits, allowing poisons to move up the food chain and causing indirect exposure (López-Valcárcel et al., 2023). Because of the bioaccumulation that this process causes, higher trophic levels—fish and marine mammals—and algae are at risk. Herbicides, in particular, target algae's photosynthetic apparatus, preventing the formation of chlorophyll and electron transport (Cao et al., 2023). Fundamental physiological functions like growth and metabolism are impacted by this interference, which has a domino effect on the structure and function of the community as a whole. Different algal species are more or less susceptible to pesticides, which can cause changes in variety and even biodiversity loss (Legrand et al., 2022). The potential to exacerbate eutrophication is one of the ecosystem-level repercussions and cascade impacts on the marine environment. A comprehensive strategy that considers the properties of pesticides, the diversity of algal communities, and the dynamics of the larger marine ecosystem is essential to reducing these vulnerabilities (Kock et al., 2022). With this knowledge, specific conservation strategies may be developed to protect algae's vital role in preserving the health of the marine ecosystem. As primary producers essential to marine ecosystems, algal communities are incredibly vulnerable to pesticide exposure. The complex interactions between pesticides and these vital creatures show difficulties requiring further investigation into their ecological consequences (Truchy et al., 2022). Algal communities directly exposed to pesticide-contaminated waters—from many sources, including urban areas, industrial operations, and agricultural runoff—experience an instant physiological stressor. Changes in growth rates, problems with photosynthesis, and, in severe situations, higher rates of algal population death are some ways this stress presents itself (Voltz et al., 2022).

Furthermore, indirect exposure via trophic relationships adds another level of intricacy. Pesticide-contaminated algae, which serve as conduits to move toxins up the marine food chain, is consumed by herbivores. This causes bioaccumulation, which puts higher trophic levels—fish and marine mammals—at risk in addition to algae (Creusot et al., 2022). Beyond specific species, this bioaccumulation affects the biological balance of the marine ecosystem as a whole. Pesticides have particularly noticeable physiological effects on algal communities, especially in herbicides targeting the photosynthetic system. Essential functions like growth and metabolism are jeopardized when there are disruptions in the generation of chlorophyll and electron transportation (Ulrich et al., 2022). The general structure and function of algal communities are affected by these disruptions, which have a cascade influence on their composition and the dynamics of the marine ecosystem. A further layer of complexity is introduced by the realization that various algae species vary in susceptibility. Changes in algal diversity brought about by this variability may result in some species becoming more dominant than others, contributing to biodiversity loss. Such changes have cascade consequences on herbivores, detritivores, and predators, affecting the larger marine environment. The hazards at the ecological level include possible eutrophication aggravation and disturbances within the algal populations (Wang et al., 2024). Changes in nitrogen cycling by pesticides may raise nutrient availability, supporting algal blooms and lowering water quality. The general resilience and vitality of the marine ecosystem are thus put in jeopardy. A comprehensive strategy that considers the many properties of pesticides, the complex dynamics within algal populations, and the larger context of marine ecosystem dynamics is required to mitigate these vulnerabilities (MacKnight et al., 2022). This knowledge lays the groundwork for creating focused conservation plans that protect the vital function of algae in preserving the health and equilibrium of marine ecosystems.

5. Disruptions in community structure and function
One of the most critical aspects of the complex interactions within marine ecosystems is the disruptions that pesticide exposure causes to the structure and function of algal populations. The composition, variety, and ecological roles of algal communities are all impacted by these changes, which have far-reaching effects on the marine ecosystem (Harb and Chow, 2022). Exposure to pesticides frequently causes changes in the relative abundance of particular algae species in communities. There may be changes in species composition and abundance due to some proving hardier and others succumbing to the toxic effects (Rosenkranz et al., 2023). This change may impact the algal community's resilience and overall biodiversity. Some species may be more resistant to pesticides than others, which could result in overrepresenting these hardy species. These changes may impact the complex equilibrium of the marine environment. Algal communities' biomass and production can change due to pesticide exposure (Kakakhel et al., 2023). Diminished rates of growth, compromised photosynthesis, and disturbances in metabolic activities may lead to variations in the community's overall production. These changes may impact the marine ecosystem's energy transfer and nitrogen cycle (Chen et al., 2024). The loss of variety within communities can be partly attributed to the sensitivity of various algae species to pesticides. Algal communities' overall diversity may decrease as some species respond to pesticide exposure by growing or declining. This biodiversity loss may jeopardize the ecosystem's ability to adapt and remain stable. Higher trophic levels of the marine food chain are affected in a cascade manner by disturbances in the structure of the algal community (Novais et al., 2023). Changes in algal quantity and composition directly impact herbivores, detritivores, and predators. Changes in the quantity and quality of prey can impact the ecosystem, affecting the distribution and abundance of different marine species. Within algal populations, pesticide-induced disturbances can alter the cycle of nutrients. In marine ecosystems, nutrient availability, absorption, and assimilation variations can impact the cycling of vital elements (Zhao et al., 2020). The microbial and algal communities may be impacted by these imbalances caused by this changed nitrogen cycle. Algal communities exposed to pesticides may become more vulnerable to other environmental stressors, such as salinity, temperature, or variations in nutrition availability. These communities' diminished resilience may make adjusting to and recovering from various environmental difficulties more challenging (Wijewardene et al., 2021).

6. Metabolism and bioaccumulation of pesticides by algae
An essential part of algae's interaction with aquatic environments is their metabolism and bioaccumulation of pesticides, which affects the fate of these pollutants in marine ecosystems. Pesticides are absorbed, changed, and accumulated by algae in this complex process that has wide-ranging effects on the food chain (Avila et al., 2021). Algae from the water column can directly absorb pesticides; active transport or diffusion are two ways the toxins can enter the cells. The concentration of pesticides, the kind of algae, and the physicochemical characteristics of the pollutants all affect the absorption rate (Mustafa et al., 2021). Once within the algal cells, pesticides go through a series of metabolic changes. Algae can have enzyme systems that convert pesticides into less harmful forms or conjugate them for simpler excretion. Algae rely on metabolism as a vital defense mechanism to withstand the harmful effects of some pesticides. Pesticide concentrations in the algal biomass can rise above those in the surrounding water due to accumulation (Goh et al., 2023). The ongoing absorption and retention of pesticides by algae cells is the cause of this bioaccumulation. Then, as predators eat infected prey, the accumulated pesticides may be transported along the food web and undergo biomagnification (Asimakis et al., 2022). The ability of various algae species to metabolize and bioaccumulate chemicals varies. Pesticides may be effectively metabolized and excreted by certain animals, but slower metabolic processes may cause more significant amounts in other species. This variability influences the overall diversity of reactions within algal communities.

Pesticides collected by algae can move to higher trophic levels through trophic interactions. When pesticide-laden algae are consumed by zooplankton and other herbivores, the toxins may build up in their tissues (Meng et al., 2022). Pesticides increase the reach of organisms, such as fish and marine mammals, at higher trophic levels due to this trophic transfer, which increases their reach along the food chain. The environment significantly impacts how pesticides are metabolized and accumulate in algae (Quan et al., 2023). Various factors, including temperature, light intensity, availability of nutrients, and water chemistry, can influence the rate and degree of pesticide uptake and transformation within algal cells. Pesticides that have been digested or not may be released by algae back into the water, thus contaminating the aquatic ecosystem as a whole (Li et al., 2022a). Various factors, including algal growth, ambient conditions, and the metabolic pathways involved, impact the dynamic process of pesticide release from algae. Comprehending the processes of pesticide metabolism and bioaccumulation by algae is crucial to appreciate the possible hazards linked to pesticide exposure in marine envir"
,,"7. Variability in effects on different algal species
Because different algae species have diverse physiologies, metabolic pathways, and susceptibilities to different toxicological processes, the impact of pesticides on those species can differ significantly. It is crucial to comprehend this variety to forecast how pesticides may affect various algae groups ecologically. Pesticides cause various algae species to react differently. Specific species might be more vulnerable to specific pollutants, while others might have built-in detoxification or toleration systems (Focardi et al., 2022). This sensitivity is frequently linked to the unique metabolic processes and defensive systems in every type of algae. It exhibits a variety of metabolic pathways that impact its capacity to break down and eliminate pollutants. Certain algae may have enzymes that may change or break down particular compounds, giving them a degree of resilience. The differences in reactions between algae species can be attributed partly to the variety of their metabolic pathways. Algal species differ in physiological traits such as cellular physiology, membrane permeability, and cell wall structure. These variations affect how pesticides are absorbed and accumulated and affect specific algae (Rajendran et al., 2022). For example, some herbicides that target cell membranes may not affect algae with more muscular cell walls. It displays a variety of growth rates, life cycles, and reproduction techniques (Mahesh et al., 2023). Pesticides can have varying effects on these factors, resulting in diverse reactions. Slower-growing species might have difficulties recovering from short-term pesticide exposure, whereas faster-growing species might be more resistant (Yaashikaa et al., 2022). Furthermore, it has specific dietary needs, and nutrient availability might affect its pesticide susceptibility. Aquatic environment nutrient levels may influence how pesticides affect the growth and metabolism of algae. Modifications in nutrient dynamics can impact the competitive relationships between various algae species (Valente et al., 2022). Over time, algae can adjust to environmental stressors, and certain species may create acclimation mechanisms in response to repeated pesticide exposure. Because of this plasticity, the long-term consequences on various algae species vary according to how well they can adapt to changing conditions (Steinhäuser et al., 2022). Interactions with other environmental conditions frequently impact the effects of pesticides on algal species. Variations in temperature, light intensity, pH, and nutrition availability can alter the effects of pesticides and cause reactions unique to individual species. It is found in intricate biological communities where interactions between various algae species may affect how they react to pesticides. A dynamic and context-dependent situation could arise from changes in the abundance and composition of one algal species, which could then have a domino effect on other algae species (Garg et al., 2023).

8. Herbicides' impact on photosynthetic activity in algae
One of the main ways that herbicides impair the physiological functions of these vital primary producers in aquatic environments is by having a substantial effect on the photosynthetic activity of algae. Depending on the type of herbicide, its concentration, and the individual algal species involved, the effects on photosynthesis can differ (Wang et al., 2022). Numerous herbicides, including diuron and atrazine, block Photosystem II (PSII), the first step in the photosynthetic electron transport chain. The first stages of photosynthesis, in which light energy is received and used to split water molecules, depend on PSII. When PSII is inhibited, electron flow is disrupted, preventing the formation of energy-rich molecules (Majewska et al., 2021). The pigment chlorophyll, necessary for absorbing light during photosynthesis, can be disrupted by herbicides. Herbicides reduce the overall efficiency of light absorption by algal cells, impeding the photosynthetic process by interfering with the manufacture of chlorophyll (Machado and Soares, 2021). The electron transport chain, a sequence of molecular processes essential for transforming light energy into chemical energy, may be interfered with by herbicides. The generation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which are necessary for driving photosynthetic activities, is jeopardized by this disturbance in the electron flow (Liu et al., 2022). Herbicides can alter the structure of the thylakoid membranes, which house the pigments involved in photosynthetic reactions and the parts responsible for electron transport. These structural changes may affect how pigment-protein complexes organize, resulting in less effective light harvesting and energy transfer. Herbicides can cause algal cells to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). Superoxide and hydrogen peroxide are examples of ROS that can harm biological components, including those that are engaged in photosynthesis. The total reduction in photosynthetic activity is a result of this oxidative stress (Hu et al., 2021). Herbicide-induced disruption of photosynthesis eventually results in a decrease in carbon fixation, which restricts the capacity of algal cells to transform carbon dioxide into organic molecules. This decrease in carbon assimilation impacts algal population productivity and general growth. Herbicide susceptibility can vary amongst algal species, leading to reactions particular to that species. Certain algae may have systems in place to detoxify or withstand specific herbicides, which can affect how a population's photosynthetic activity is affected overall (Du et al., 2023b).

9. Relationships between pesticide concentration and algal response
Algae may react minimally or not to low pesticide doses, and the consequences may not be noticeable. The term ""no observed effect concentration"" (NOEC) is frequently used to describe this threshold level. The herbicide has no discernible effect on photosynthesis, algae development, or other physiological processes below this threshold (Du et al., 2023a). A dose-response connection is usually observed in algal responses as pesticide concentrations rise over the threshold. This indicates a direct relationship between the pesticide concentration and the size of the algal response (Su et al., 2022). Typical patterns can be sigmoidal curves, linear responses, or more intricate correlations based on the particular pesticide and algae species. Algae exposed to moderate pesticide concentrations may experience a stress response that modifies physiological and biochemical characteristics. Changes in growth rates, photosynthetic efficiency, and cellular metabolism may be among them. The kind of pesticide used and the algal species' tolerance are two factors that frequently influence the type and strength of the stress response. Certain algae may show an optimum or stimulatory response when pesticide concentrations are low to moderate (Gardia-Parège et al., 2022). Hormesis is the process that happens when low amounts of stimuli enhance specific components of algal growth or metabolic activity. However, the stimulatory effects are usually followed by adverse effects at larger dosages. Algae develop a hazardous threshold, at which point the adverse effects intensify beyond a particular concentration. Examples of this could include severe declines in growth, inhibition of photosynthesis, harm to cells, or even death (Ou et al., 2022). The hazardous threshold is an essential factor in determining the possible harm to algal communities. Depending on the length of exposure, algae can react differently to different pesticide dosages. Acute reactions, which are transient, can directly affect photosynthesis and growth. When chronic responses are seen over long periods, they can have cumulative impacts like changes in the dynamics of ecosystems or the composition of communities. Interactions with other stressors or environmental factors may impact the link between pesticide concentration and algal response (Tang et al., 2023). Algal sensitivity to pesticides can be modulated by temperature, light intensity, and nutrition availability, resulting in intricate and context-dependent connections. The degree to which different algae species are sensitive to pesticide doses can vary. Certain species are more resilient, but others are more vulnerable. Within algal communities, this species-specific variety adds to the overall diversity of responses (Weiner et al., 2004).

10. Synergistic or antagonistic effects on algal communities
In aquatic environments, algal colonies must navigate the complex interplay of several stressors, including pesticides. The results of these interactions might be antagonistic, in which stressors balance one other out to provide a less severe effect, or synergistic, in which the whole impact surpasses the sum of the individual effects. Pesticides can synergistically impact algal communities by magnifying the adverse effects of mixing with other environmental stressors. For example, more significant stress on algal populations may result from co-exposure to a pesticide and conditions such as increasing nutrient levels or elevated temperature (Elersek et al., 2021). The combined attack might be too much for algae's natural defense, leading to higher mortality, slower growth rates, and changes in how communities are organized.

On the other hand, antagonistic effects help algal communities to some extent when stressors work together to lessen each other's effects. In some cases, the presence of another stressor with a mitigating impact can partially balance the detrimental effects of a pesticide on algal growth (Braga et al., 2020). A less severe response than anticipated may arise from this interaction, depending on the specific effects of each stressor. These interactions have complicated dynamics by nature, and they frequently depend on a variety of external influences. The nature of synergistic or antagonistic effects can be modulated by temperature, light intensity, and nutrient levels. Stressors can work in concert under certain circumstances, but they can also operate antagonistically under other circumstances (Gebara et al., 2020). This intricacy draws attention to how difficult it is to forecast the biological effects of various stressors on algal colonies. It takes a sophisticated understanding of these relationships to develop management and conservation plans that work (Zhang et al., 2022). In order to ensure a thorough assessment of the cumulative impacts on aquatic ecosystems, monitoring efforts and research projects must take into account the nuances of synergistic and antagonistic effects. Scientists and conservationists can improve their capacity to protect the resilience and well-being of algal populations against a variety of stressors by deciphering this complexity (Wang et al., 2023)."
,,"11. Examining specific cases of pesticide impacts on algal communities
Examining particular cases of pesticide effects on algal communities offers essential insights into how intricate and varied these interactions are. Pesticides affect algal physiology, development, and community dynamics in a variety of ways, which emphasizes the significance of taking into account the particular setting in which these interactions take place. A prominent illustration is the pesticide atrazine, which is extensively employed in farming. Atrazine mainly inhibits Photosystem II (PSII), a component of the photosynthetic machinery of algae (Loerracher et al., 2023). A series of negative consequences follow, including decreased photosynthetic activity, growth retardation, and changes in community organization. This effect affects a variety of algae, including diatoms and green algae, and is especially noticeable in freshwater conditions. Another example with unique results is the broad-spectrum herbicide glyphosate. Its influence on algal communities extends beyond direct toxicity (Larras et al., 2022). Glyphosate can induce shifts in algal community composition, favoring certain species while adversely affecting others. While some algae may exhibit resistance, certain nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria can thrive, altering the overall balance of the community and affecting nutrient dynamics. In aquatic systems, copper-based algicides are employed for controlling algal blooms. However, these algicides contribute to bioaccumulation in algal tissues, leading to unintended impacts on non-target algae. Excessive copper concentrations disrupt cellular processes, including photosynthesis, and contribute to changes in community structure. Neonicotinoid insecticides, such as imidacloprid, exemplify the interconnectedness of trophic levels in aquatic ecosystems. These insecticides work against pests, but by lowering the population of zooplankton, they also have an indirect effect on algal ecosystems (Cutler et al., 2022). Algal biomass and composition are altered as a result of the ensuing modifications in grazing pressure on algae. The reactions of algae to carbaryl and other carbamate pesticides vary. Some species might withstand carbamates and eventually recover, while others might see a decrease. This variety emphasizes how crucial it is to take into account the diversity of algae, the length of exposure, and particular pesticide features when evaluating the long-term effects on algal ecosystems (Shahi Khalaf Ansar et al., 2023). When it comes to pyrethroid insecticides, such as bifenthrin, the emphasis on controlling insects could have unforeseen effects on algae that are not the intended target. These insecticides have the potential to interfere with algal development and photosynthesis, causing imbalances in algal populations and highlighting the broader ecological effects of pesticide use. When evaluating the effects of pesticides on algal communities, a sophisticated and case-specific approach is necessary, as these particular situations demonstrate. Comprehending the range of reactions, the adaptability of algae, and the interrelated processes in aquatic environments is crucial for well-informed conservation and management tactics meant to lessen the ecological effects of pesticide application (K et al., 2023). Fig. 2 shows the effect of chemical fertilizers release on water bodies and Table 2 shows the effects of algal bloom species on water bodies.

,,"12. Algae vulnerability to pesticides
It's hardly remarkable that perhaps the responsiveness of algae to pesticides varies greatly. Microbes are classified into 3 kingdoms, with over 50,000 distinct species of algae, bacteria, as well as protozoa (Gierer et al., 2019). Microbes are available in an array of sizes as well as morphological characteristics, occur across every conceivable ecosystem, and also have numerous feed intake types, mobile as well as nonmobile formation, and a broad range of mating strategies as well as growth rates (Prasad et al., 2016). The overwhelming bulk of pesticide information on aquatic microbes is for algae. The majority of such pesticide residues investigated are herbicides, as well as atrazine is really the herbicide that received the most thorough research (Narayanan et al., 2022; Narayanan et al., 2020). There have been far lesser pesticide investigations on aquatic algae. The majority of EC50s (Effective Concentrations) with in microalgae toxicological studies mentioned below were ascertained utilizing growth rate as such an end destination (de Paula et al., 2022). In general, the rate of algal blooms was measured utilizing direct cell counts as well as optical density.

The timeframe of such experiments varied, ranging from the most typical exposures lasting 24–96 h (Morrissey et al., 2015). Microbial studies from across all aquatic environments were included, with such a focus on marine as well as aquatic algal species. The researchers are organized by pesticide types and include information for pesticide residues (e.g., DDT) which are no longer recorded to be utilized in the US but are habitually identified in water bodies (Islam et al., 2018b). Table 3 shows the comparing the effects of different pesticide classes on algae susceptibility."
,,"12.1. Chlorinated hydrocarbons
The influence of chlorinated-hydrocarbons on salt as well as freshwater micro and macroalgae elicited a variety of responses. At dosages of 1 mg L−1 of aldrin, endrin, and dieldrin seemed to have no adverse effect on the respiration of blue-green as well as green algae (Saha et al., 2017). Aldrin as well as dieldrin reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels but just not algae population levels at higher amounts of 100 mg L−1. Interestingly, the aldrin seems to be the minimum inhibitory of such three substances, with marine microalgae being more tolerant compared to freshwater algae. The DDT dosages less than 10 mg L−1 had been identified as inhibiting photosynthesis in saltwater planktonic algae (Li et al., 2022b). The 9-DDT impeded photosynthetic for CO2 sequestration in the green algal species Selenastrum capricornutum at dosages ranging from 3.6 to 36 mg L−1. Only about 0.3 mg L−1 of DDT had an effect on Chlorella sp. DDT sensitivity was discovered in the bluegreen algae namely Anabaena sp. at 1 mg L−1 (Shahi Khalaf Ansar et al., 2022). Mirex, a further organochlorine, seemed to have no impact on ocean micro algae at 0.2 mg L−1, despite being doses 10,000 times either by algae (Nieder et al., 2018). In another investigation, about 100 mg L−1 of mirex as well as methoxychlor impeded the algal growth slightly (hui Shan et al., 2022). About 50 mg L−1 blend of mirex as well as methoxychlor seemed to have no impact on population expansion.

Toxicological values in S. capricornutum have been observed to reduce from 150 mg L−1 for phenol to 0.42 mg L−1 for pentachlorophenol in such an investigation of such contrasting impacts of chlorophenols (Han et al., 2022). Hence, the toxic effects rose as the quantity of replaced chlorine atoms enhanced.

12.2. Endosulfan
Endosulfan is indeed a chlorinated and cyclodiene insecticide that is chemically synthesised with identical chemical substances as used in DDT (Richardson et al., 2019). It is the sole pesticide of such a class that continues to be employed with in various nations. It is used in the production of cereals, vegetables, cotton, fruits, tobacco, tea plants, and so on. Endosulfan inhibited propagation with in green algae namely Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Sehrawat et al., 2021). Meiosis was postponed for 5 days by a brief exposure as during 4 developmental periods of such sexual life span. The productions of gametes as well as the emergence of zygote have been unaffected. When 10.17 mg L−1 of endosulfan was implemented to pre-gametogenesis cells, it reduced meiotic division by 35 % when compared with controls. Endosulfan exposure reduced the populations of 1st day dividing zygotes by up to 100 %. Endosulfan dosages of about 47 as well as 130 mg L−1 chronically impeded female development as well as tetrasporophytes respectively in marine red algae namely Champia parvula (Ukhurebor et al., 2021).

Higher concentrations, ranging from 360 - 600 mg L−1, resulted in long-term reproductive effects/abnormalities in the algae. Endosulfan had a maximum possible toxicant dosage of 48 mg L−1 in C. parvula. Furthermore, 10 mg L−1 dosage of Endosulfan reduced C. vulgaris growth spead through 15 %, as well as 100 mg L−1 dosage of endosulfan severely inhibited the algae growth. The 10-day LC50 had been found to be 41 mg L−1. Growth had been lowered in Anabaena doliolum, while exposed to 0.1–100 mg L−1 dosages of endosulfan, as well as growth had been totally stopped at dosage of >3 mg L−1 with the 10-day LC50 of 2.15 mg L−1 (Venkateswarlu, 2021). Furthermore, the endosulfan inhibited the growth of Anabaena sp. (52 %) as well as Aulosira fertilissima (38 %) at 1 mg L−1 endosulfan. Besides that at 20 mg L−1 dosage of endosulfan inhibited the photosynthesis process in A. fertilissima up to 40.2 % (Chin et al., 2019). Anabaena sp. as well as A. fertilissima was discovered to quickly accumulate as well as concentrate the endosulfan. Endosulfan had also been biotransformed through the bluegreen algae into endosulfan ether as well as then endosulfan lactone, as reported by investigators (Sathishkumar et al., 2021). Westiellopsis prolifica growth had been hindered by endosulfan at 10 mg L−1 concentration, as well as N2 fixation had been lowered by 93 % with 100 mg L−1 dosage. Endosulfan was also discovered to have been more harmful towards the cyanobacterium namely Anabaena sp. than just to the green algae namely Chlorella sp. (Deviram et al., 2020) The effective accumulation of endosulfan within the cell had been believed to be accountable for Chlorella sp delayed growth inhibition. Endosulfan sensitivity was higher in both algae compared to the organophosphorus pesticides dimethoate (Chen et al., 2016).

Endosulfan was also studied for its side effects on mixotrophic microbial population in water as well as sediments from the estuaries. Endosulfan harmfully inhibited 31 % of aquatic bacterial populations at 0.002 mg L−1 and 71 % at 2 mg L−1 concentrations. The Pseudomonas sp. made the greatest number of endosulfan-resistant bacteria (Kumar et al., 2021). Endosulfan sensitivity was higher in algae enumerated from polluted water samples than sediment. An investigation of estuarine microbiomes discovered that algal abundance had been reduced by 1 as well as 10 mg L−1 of endosulfan, but heterotrophic algal was not (Naskar et al., 2022). At one and ten mg L−1 dosage of endosulfan, the phototrophic biovolume had also been lowered, as well as the abundance of many cyanobacterial species decreased (Smedbol et al., 2018). There wasn't any discernible effect upon that abundance of heterotrophic ciliates or flagellates.

12.3. Organophosphate insecticides
A study found that 100 mg L−1 malathion had very little influence on the green algae namely Chlorella pyrenoidosa that accumulated about 50–72 mg L−1 dosage of parathion and had no influence on bluegreen as well as green algae (Deviram et al., 2020). Moreover, at 7.86 g L−1, the parathion had been identified as inhibiting reproduction in Chlorella fusca. The N2 fixing blue green algae namely, Aulosira fertilissima, and Cylindrospermum sp., grew successfully in the existence of 300 as well as 400 mg L−1 dosage of diazinon, respectively. Malathion used to have a limited growth inhibition activity upon that bluegreen alga: Chlorogloea fritschii at 200 mg L−1, was irrevocably inhibited (Trac et al., 2016). Malathion can also inhibit the chlorophyll synthesis (100 %) in Vaucheria sp., Stigeoclonium sp., and Tribonema sp., at 1 mg L−1. This investigation additionally showed that even in the light condition, algae can deteriorate the malathion.

Axenic based batch cultures of about 12 aquatic (freshwater) algae were employed to investigate the impact of organophosphate insecticide namely fenitrothion upon that phytoplanktons (Riaz et al., 2021): Scenedesmus obliquus, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, C. segnis, Pediastrum sp., Staurastrum sp., Cosmarium sp., Chlorella pyrenoidosa, and C. vulgaris growth rate. The crop yield was drastically decreased across all species at 10 mg L−1 (Riaz et al., 2021). The proposed mechanism of action was just that fenitrothion inhibited regular mitotic division series mechanisms, actually results in a deposition of macromolecules as well as a rise in cell biomass/weight. Overall membrane lipids content was determined to be closely linked to fenitrothion responsiveness, implying that lipophilic substances are much more harmful to green algae with higher lipid fragments (Nunes et al., 2017). Fenitrothion at concentrations of 5 as well as 10 mg L−1 bleached the chlorophyll pigment across many blue green algae (Riaz et al., 2021).

An investigation into the impact of dimethoate as well as thimeton upon Scenedesmus incrassatulus development demonstrated that doses above 0.075 as well as 0.5 mg L−1 respectively, entirely inhibited algae growth (DeLorenzo et al., 2001). All pesticides significantly reduced the levels of algal biomolecules such as proteins as well as carbohydrates. Such pesticides drastically decreased cell concentration at >1 %. Their toxic effects were caused by a decrease in cell carotenoid and molecule chlorophyll content indirectly. Another researcher reported that Chlorella vulgaris as well as Anabaena doliolum had 10-day LC50s of 51 as well as 29 mg L−1, respectively, when revealed to dimethoate (Ramakrishnan et al., 2010). At 10 as well as 100 mg L−1, the organophosphorous insecticide temephos promoted the emergence of N2 fixing bluegreen algae as well as the green algae namely Chlamydomonas sp. Similarly, the diatom Navicula pelliculosa as well as the green algae C. pyrenoidosa, moreover, did not grow in identical doses.

The diatom namely Navicula minima, bluegreen algae namely Oscillatoria sp., and Coccochloris peniocystis as well as the bacterium: Vibrio natrigens have been less susceptible, as well as C. vulgaris growth as well as the bacterium namely Vibrio natrigens was unaffected by temephos doses of 5 mg L−1 (Saha et al., 2021). The Microtoxt experiment was used to assess the toxic effects of 7 organophosphate pesticides as well as their metabolic products (Selmi et al., 2018). The EC50 for parathion was 8.5 mg L−1, as well as the EC50 for such metabolite as 4-nitrophenol was 13.7 mg L−1. The EC50s for chlorpyrifos as well as its metabolites such as 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol were 46 as well as 19 mg L−1, respectively (Rodriguez et al., 2011). Isofenphos as well as its metabolic products, salicyclic acid as well as isopropyl salicylate, had EC50s of 98, 214, as well as 6 mg L−1 respectively. Moreover, the Diazinon had such a lower EC50 than Chlorpyrifos. Like many other organophosphate pesticides (chlorpyrifos) is indeed an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. The chemical structures a rever"
,,"At 0.24 and 0.64 mg L−1 (48-h growth rate EC50s), chlorpyrifos was toxic to the marine diatoms Skeletonema costatum and Minutocellus polyorphus, respectively. Chlorpyrifos at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mg L−1 inhibited growth within blue green alga namely Anabaena sp. Other investigations have delves into the toxic effects of chlorpyrifos in aquatic habitats. The scientists discovered that about 0.02 mg L−1 of chlorpyrifos substantially minimised the DO and increased free CO2 (Ribeiro et al., 2015). The ample supply of zooplankton had been drastically decreased, while phytoplankton had been unchanged. A research group reported that an increase in DO as well as a reduction in frees CO2 in various habitats with chlorpyrifos concentrations of 4, 10, and 1000 mg L−1.

Growth of algae was much more common in ponds handled with chlorpyrifos. Researchers found that 7 as well as 72 mg L−1 chlorpyrifos increased phytoplankton abundant supply in lakes and reservoirs (Li et al., 2023a). Cyanobacterial blooms such as Anabaena sp. and Anabaenopsis sp. occurred at both tested concentrations. The concentration of chlorpyrifos in aquatic systems increased considerably 30–50 days following exposure. In indoor aquatic microalgae such as Anabaena sp. had been chronically exposed to doses of 0.1 mg L−1 chlorpyrifos and 5 mg L−1 atrazine (Baruah and Chaurasia, 2020). There were no chlorpyrifos influences on algal blooms, but atrazine sensitivity resulted in a slight reduction in photosynthesis rate. In interior microcosms that simulated drainage systems, the influence of chlorpyrifos in mixture to nutrient concentration had been investigated. The integration of insecticide as well as nutrients enhanced phytoplankton abundant supply as well as periphytonic biomass more than nutritional advancements alone (Chakraborty and Chakraborty, 2021).

The rise was attributed to lesser arthropod grazing animals. Another analysis revealed that 10 mg L−1 chlorpyrifos substantially lowered the abundant supply of ciliates in a natural microbial population. At 10 mg L−1 doses of chlorpyrifos, there was a rise in bacterial abundant supply as well as profitability, as well as a reduce in chlorophylls a and b (Younes et al., 2023). Chlorpyrifos induced a persistent decrease in the development of most phytoplankton in such a water resources aquatic community at such a user application density of 1.2 mg L−1. In overall, such community research data show that zooplankton hunting frequently causes a rise in algae after subjected with organophosphates.

13. Pyrethroid group pesticides/herbicides
13.1. Carbamate
The EC50 for carbofuran was 20.5 mg L−1, whereas the EC50s for its own metabolites such as carbofuran phenol as well as methylamine were 61 and 35 mg L−1, respectively. Author investigated the inter - specific responsiveness of green algae such as Scenedesmus quadricauda as well as Selenastrum capricornutum, diatoms: Cyclotella meneghiana and Nitzschia sp. as well as cyanobacteria: Anabaena inaequalis, Microcystis aeruginosa, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, Oscillatoria sp., and Pseudoanabaena sp to 3.7 mg L−1 of carbaryl and discovered 50 % inhibition of and uptake 90 % of algae evaluated (Dreher et al., 2022). While implemented just at EEC of 0.67 mg L−1, a further carbamate and carbofuran had remarkably low toxic effects among most species examined. According to one study, 100 mg L−1 of the insecticide namely carbaryl lowered Chlorella pyrenoidosa population size through 30 % as well as had been capable of inhibiting at levels as small as 0.1 mg L−1 (Gonçalves et al., 2021). Carbaryl was toxic to ocean algal blooms, killing 2 species at 1 mg L−1 as well as all 5 life forms evaluated at 10 mg L−1. Carbaryl at 10 mg L−1 had no impact on the development of Nostoc muscorum and yet augmented the growth of blue green algae such as Cylindrospermum sp. (Agrawal et al., 2014). Table 4 shows the assessing the vulnerability of aquatic algae to different pesticide groups."
,,"13.2. Organotin insecticides
At about135 mg L−1, the organotin pesticide namely azocyclotin had been identified as inhibiting the picoplankton of 2 mm as well as algae of 2–10 mm in such an aquatic microalgal investigation, as well as microalgae (e.g., Kirchneriella sp.) toward less sensitive ecosystems had been noted (Ramakrishnan et al., 2010). The aquatic diatoms Skeletonema costatum as well as Minutocellus polyorphus were used to test the toxic effects of tributyltin chloride, as well as tributyltin oxide (Akcha et al., 2022). The tributyltin oxide 48-h annual growth EC50s for S. costatum as well as M. polyorphus had been 0.34 as well as 0.33 mg L−1, respectively. Tributyltin chloride was found to have similar concentrations of 0.33 mg L−1 (S. costatum) as well as 0.36 mg L−1 (M. polyorphus) (Akcha et al., 2022).

13.3. Herbicides
A phenoxyalkane herbicide such as 2,4-D had a negative impact on aquatic algal communities just at large dosages. A research reveals that Chlorella fusca multiplication/reproduction wasn't really inhibited <88 g L−1 of 2,4-D. A further investigation employing 4 flagellated algal species found that 100 mg L−1 of 2,4-D had no adverse effect on photosynthesis process upon 7 days (Mykhaylenko and Zolotareva, 2017). A study of nine microalgae species subjected to 3.0 mg L−1 of 2,4-D EEC noticed a 10 % inhibitory activity of 14C absorption across every one of the algae evaluated. A further pheoxyalkane herbicide namely 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid, has been found to have low toxic effects when applied to identical microalgae species when assessed at such an EEC of 1.4 g L−1. The EC50 for 2,4-D was 0.1 g L−1, while the EC50 for such hydrolysis degradation products, 2,4-dichlorophenol, had been 5.0 mg L−1 (Ma et al., 2021). The EC50 of structurally related weedkiller 2,4,5-T was 52 mg L−1, as well as the EC50 of its own metabolites such as 2,4–5-trichlorophenol was 1.8 mg L−1. Investigative reporter highlighted 7-d rate of growth EC50 attributes for 9 macro algae in such an environmental risk evaluation of such brominated weedkiller diquat, ranged from 1 mg L−1 for the pyrrophyte-Peridinium cinctum to 2950 mg L−1 for Euglena gracilis (Abu-Ghosh et al., 2021).

Diquat sensitivity was higher in blue green algae as well as chrysophytes than that in green algae species. A resemblance of 9 microalgae species subjected to EEC of 0.8 mg

L−1 diquat revealed a 53 to 69 % inhibitory activity of 14C absorption with in 2 green microalgae species, a up to 100 % reduction with in 2 diatom species, and just a 100 % reduction among all 5 cyanobacteria studied species. At doses of 0.3 mg L−1, associated with substantially changed the microalgae as well as bacterial intensities of naturally produced microbial populations evaluated in aquatic microhabitats (Arias et al., 2020). At diquat doses, the biodiversity of protozoa had also been significantly reduced. At 0.3 mg L−1, with really no discernible rehabilitation was found in 21 days later. In conversely, while evaluated at such an EEC of 0.3 mg L−1, a further halogenated herbicide, and bromoxynil did not substantially inhibit 14C accumulation among the various microalgae species. In another investigation, paraquat implementation to naturally produced freshwater microalgae populations inhibited cyanobacteria e.g. Phormidium sp. at 10 mg L−1.

At their EEC, a research team further identified 2 pyridine herbicides: such as picloram and triclorpyr 1.8 and 2.6 mg L−1 respectively (Ghosh et al., 2016). Such substances did not significantly impede carbon absorption among the various algal studied species. However, the aldehyde-based herbicide acrolein, inhibited carbon accumulation across all algae species. At such an EEC of 1 mg L−1 of algal species were reduced up to 95 %. Glyphosate, a glucuronic acid speculative weedkiller, used to have a substantial influence on carbon absorption with in diatoms: Cyclotella meneghiana, as well as Nitzschia sp. the N2 fixing cyanobacterium: namely Aphanizomenon flos-aquae yet had no influence or slight inhibitory effects on all other 7 algal species. In some other investigation, fresh - water periphyton populations had 4-h EC50 value compared from 9 to 90 mg L−1 glyphosate (Cruz de Carvalho et al., 2020). Herbicides containing phenylurea have a broad spectrum of impacts on algae. Monuron at 4 mg L−1 additions to Chlorella sp. communities reduced rate of growth. In one study, diuron had been found to be among the most harmful phenylurea evaluated, killing marine algal life forms at 4 mg L−1.

The substances had been listed in significantly reducing toxic effects order: fenuron, diuron, neburon, and monuron. The substances distinguish in their capacity to hinder photosynthesis as well as their hydrophilicity, with poor solubility provoking deposition with in algal cell. Chlortoluron, a further phenylurea substance, inhibited recreation in Chlorella fusca at a concentration of 24 mg L−1 (Ukhurebor et al., 2021). Utilizing macro and micro algae species, a research team investigated the toxic effects of 4 sulfonylurea herbicides such as metsulfuron-methyl (0.003 mg L−1), chlorsulfuron (0.02 mg L−1), triasulfuron (0.018 mg L−1), and ethametsulfuron-methyl (0.015 mg L−1) (Wijntjes et al., 2022). There was minimal or no or poor inhibition of carbon absorption among the various algal tested organisms just at EEC. The supplemented urea weedkiller tebuthiuron, was especially poisonous to the identical microalgae species. At such an EEC of 6 mg L−1 tebuthiuron, considerable inhibition of 14C absorption had been noted across all species examined. An acetanilide herbicide namely metolachlor as well as an imidazolinone herbicide such as imazethapyr, respectively were also evaluated but showed slight toxic effects to microalgae species.

About 3 mg L−1 of metolachlor strongly suppressed carbon absorption with in green algae and cyanobacterium such as Selenastrum capricornutum as well as Pseudoanabaena sp., respectively but 0.067 mg L−1 of imazethapyr only inhibited the growth of cyanobacterium namely Microcystis aeruginosa (Tarannum and Khan, 2020). Chloroplast abnormalities may result in weedkiller binding as well as suppression damage in tolerant algae species. Interestingly, the diuron-resistant Euglena gracilis, Chlamydomonas reinhardii, and Bumilleriopsis filiformis strains have indeed been identified.

The photosynthetic activity inhibitors simazine as well as atrazine have become less resistant towards the C. reinhardii (diruon-resistant) line than diuron as well as monuron, however they were usually susceptible to bromacil (Cruz de Carvalho et al., 2020; Puiseux-Dao, 2018). The diuron-resistant E. gracilis is also resistant to o-phenanthrolene. At 1400 mg L−1 of triazine herbicide: anilazine hindered the reproduction/multiplication of Chlorella fusca, whilst simazine produced a comparable influence at just >26 mg L−1 (Staley et al., 2015). Upon 7 days, 1 mg L−1 of simazine exposure considerably minimised the chlorophyll yield in 3 flagellated microalgae species. The Gardoprim, is a triazine (>0.05 mg L−1) inhibited growth rate of freshwater algal group, whilst gesapax had no negative impacts at 0.1 mg L−1. Researchers studied the inter - specific responsiveness of Anabaena inaequalis, Cyclotella meneghiana, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, Microcystis aeruginosa, Scenedesmus quadricauda, Pseudoanabaena sp., Oscillatoria sp., Nitzschia sp., and Selenastrum capricornutum sensitive to 5 triazine herbicides implemented just at EECs (Ramakrishnan et al., 2010).

Those algae were hindered by 2.7, 2.6, 2.8, 2.6, 2.6 mg L−1 of atrazine, cyanazine, hexazinone, metribuzin, as well as simazine respectively by >50 % by reducing the chlorophyll a levels as well as modified the taxonomic composition. While at increased concentration, it considerably reduced the algal densities. In synthetic waterways, atrazine and alachlor have been discovered to have considerable consequences on benthic algal populations. The biovolume of the microalgae population was lowered by 90 mg L−1 alachlor as well as 12 −150 mg L−1 of atrazine (Andrus et al., 2013).

13.4. Atrazine
Atrazine is just an s-triazine herbicide that is predominantly were using to regulate broadleaf as well as grassy weeds. Atrazine is indeed an algistatic compound that inhibits photosynthetic activity by interfering with electron transfer during reaction of photosystem II (Bhat et al., 2022). The responses of algae to atrazine are highly dependent on the dosages used the exposure time, as well as the algal species evaluated. Numerous experiments have been carried out to investigate the impact of atrazine on micro and macroalgae. Researchers discovered that atrazine reduced growth rates in 5 distinct algae up to 5000 mg L−1. Phaeodactylum tricornutum was found to just be unlikely to be affected by 50 mg L−1 atrazine, while that typical quantity of atrazine hindered the growth rate of Nannochloris oculata through approximately 35 % (Chen et al., 2018).

Upon 7 days of being subjected to 1 mg L−1 atrazine, chlorophyll concentrations decreased up to 67 % in the algal species such as Chlorella vulgaris as well as Stigeoclonium tenue, along with the blue green algae Oscillatoria lutea (Singh et al., 2018). The blue green algae Anabaena flosaquae had also 3-, 5-, as well as 7-day growth rate as EC50s of 58, 469, as well as 776 mg L−1 respectively. Upon 5 days of being exposed, the seawater phytoplankter Skeletonema costatum demonstrated a reduction in culture growth as well as fluorescence up to 22 mg L−1 of atrazine. Skeletonema costatum and Minutocellus polyorphus had 48-hour EC50 values of 50 as well as 20 mg L−1, respectively. Toxic effects experiments with 5 different species of such Scenedesmus sp. (green algae) yielded EC50s for growth rates ranging from 22 to 300 mg L−1 after 3–14 h (Nema et al., 2019). In microcosm as well as investigational pond experiments, the toxicity of atrazine had been compared utilizing 8 different algal species. The mean 24-h EC50 morals for 14C absorption usually range from 37 to 308 mg L−1 for each species, with green algal species being so much more susceptible than bluegreens. The EC50 values through microcosms ranged from 103 to 159 mg L−1, while the EC50 in investigational ponds had been 100 mg L−1. In some other investigation, the toxic effects of mecoprop, atrazine, and isoproturon to the algal species Scenedesmus subspicatus were investigated (Stenström et al., 2021).

The calculated 96-h rate of growth EC50s had been 21 mg L−1 (each) of atrazine, isoproturon, as well as 10 g L−1 of mecoprop. A 28-d of atrazine exposed of 4 green algae such as Chlorella sp., Chlamydomonas sp., Scenedesmus quadricauda, and Pediastrum sp., as well as 4 diatoms: Cyclotella gamma, Cyclotella meneghiniana, Synedra radians, and Synedra acus produced EC50s ranged from 28 to 111 mg L−1 for green algae species as well as 89 to 430 mg L−1 for the diatoms. Another investigation reported that about 0.23 mM atrazine inhibited growth by approximately 85 % by Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, while it inhibited the growth up to 60 % in Scenedesmus quadricauda (Tucci et al., 2019). A 96-h rate of growth at EC50 of about 147 mg L−1 of atrazine was calculated in a laboratory experiment only with estuary phytoplankton namely Pavlova sp.

Interestingly, the Phaeodactylum tricornutum was unaffected through 50 mg L−1 of atrazine, but same dosage inhibited the Nannochloris oculata growth up to 35 %. The green alga such as Chlamydomonas sp. had been noticed to be very susceptible, with such a 1-h EC50 of 60 mg L−1 as an end destination utilizing O2 production inhibitory activity. The 1 h EC50 for 8 aquatic diatom strains ranged from 84 to 460 mg L−1 for Cyclotella nana and Navicula inserta respectively. A further study reported that the reduced rates of photosynthetic activity as well as cell counts for diatom species enumerated from a Georgia salt (Nitzschia sigma and Thalassiosira fluviatilis) marsh after a 7-day severe atrazine herbicide exposure (Hernando et al., 2015). The highest safe amount of atrazine with in this salt marsh had been ascertained to be 10 mg L−1 based on the lowest effect of atrazine on diatoms. In an investigation of the impact of atrazine on innate algae aggregations, 20 mg L−1 lowered the algal production efficiency as well as biomass, accompanied by a 7-day restoration to normal values. Another research found that applying 100 mg L−1 of atrazine to lagoon enclosures resulted in substantial decreases in phytoplankton species populations (Liber et al., 2020). The modifications in diversity and composition lasted 77 days. At 100–200 mg L−1 atrazine, net primary performance, pH, as well as respiration proportions had been lowered in naturally produced algal populations. In some other research, 153 mg L−1 of atrazine minimized the chlorophyll levels for 7 to 14 days before recovering.

Upon 14 days, higher amount remained detrimental to photosynthetic activity as well as chlorophyll content, resulting in a decrease in green algal populations. In such a microalgae investigation of periphyton communities, the atrazine dosages of about 10 mg L−1 or less stimulated protein rich biomass, chlorophyll content, as well as species abundance, whilst the high doses led to a substantial loss of benthic micro as well as macro algae species and biomass/organic matter, and also negative net O2 production. Atrazine dosages ranged from 0.8 to 1.56 mg L−1 were also observed to decrease appended pond microalgal productive capacity up to 82 % (Takeshita et al., 2022). An atrazine investigation in stream wetland microhabitats disclosed that at 25 mg L−1, periphyton gross primary performance had been substantially lowered upon 27-d exposure. Similarly, at 50 mg L−1, the atrazine dosage the periphyton acquired resistance. Constant atrazine dosages of 0.5 mg - 5 g L−1 were administered in lake microhabitat. The investigator additionally identified a 50 mg L−1 reduction in photosynthetic activity.

According to research, periphyton populations aren't made quite resistant to atrazine upon prior exposure (Sharma et al., 2022). In certain cases, algae have shown heightened susceptibility towards the herbicide after such a prolonged exposure as well as recovery process. Using only a freshwater periphyton population, scientists discovered a lower capacity for algae towards becoming tolerant to atrazine. Numerous researchers indicated modifications to community constituents; however the relative responsiveness of taxonomic groups was inconsistent. Planktonic green algae as well as flagellates had been lowered in pond aquatic research findings, whilst also cryptophytes (particularly Cryptomonas) as well as chrysophytes (particularly Mallomonas) enhanced in ample supply (Hamilton et al., 2021). Another study found that green algae, dinoflagellates, and diatoms populations were decreased in confined phytoplankton populations subjected to 100 mg L−1 of atrazine, while chrysophytes remained unaffected as well as cryptophytes slightly increased. In research lab streams subjected to 100 mg L−1 of atrazine, the diatoms and cryptophytes populations decreased while blue green algae populations increased (Fugère et al., 2020). In estuary microhabitats treated with 40 as well as 160 mg L−1 of atrazine, a related taxonomic change was noticed.

Another research found that 100 mg L−1 killed bluegreen algae yet had no adverse affect on diatoms. Reduced DO dosages are consistently detected in conjunction with atrazine-induced significant reduction in photosynthetic activity, resulting lowest productivity. Some changes in water quality include decreases in pH as well as inorganic carbon, as well as enhances in alkalinity as well as conductivity. Such responses have been associated with decreased bicarbonate photosynthetic absorption. Numerous investigators have documented raises in inorganic N2 and P as a result of reduced nutrient absorption rates. Deethylatrazine is a particularly harmful substrate of atrazine. At 50 mg L−1 of deethylatrazine decreased dramatically chlorophyll a substance, photoautotrophic carbon absorption, photoautotrophic biovolume, as well as DO levels in estuary microbial populations (Kráľová and Jampílek, 2022).

13.5. Fungicides
In such a thiocarbamate correlation, maneb hindered the development of Euglena gracilis more often than zineb, whereas nabam had been hazardous throughout all examine. Bluegreen algae are relatively insecticide-resistant but extremely sensitive to the mentioned previously fungicides (Thiour-Mauprivez et al., 2019). While integrated at such a concentration of 60 mg L−1 in the agar medium, ethyl mercury phosphate had been deadly to every marine plankton tested organisms. Scientists determined that 3 organo-mercury based fungicides, at concentrations <1 mg L−1, inhibited growth of algal blooms as well as photosynthetic activity. These results revealed that marine as well as freshwater algae had been sensitive to organo-mercury substances at thresholds lower than those suggested for water quality requirements at the time, implying that certain substances must be avoided entering natural waters. In an additional latest report, the responsiveness of 9 algal species towards the triazole speculative fungicide namely propiconazole was compared. The suppression of 14C absorption varied from 0 - 31 % just at EEC of about 0.08 mg L−1, only with Scenedesmus quadricauda as well as the cyanobacterium namely Microcystis sp. among the most responsive species evaluated and reported (Zubrod et al., 2019).

14. Recommendations for future research
Future studies on the effects of pesticides on algal populations should concentrate on filling in critical knowledge gaps and deepening our comprehension of the intricate relationships that underlie these ecological processes. Perform integrated assessments that take into account a variety of stressors at once, such as pesticides, nutrient levels, temperature, and lighting. This methodology will yield a more pragmatic comprehension of the responses exhibited by algal populations to intricate environmental situations. To track the long-term effects of pesticides on algal ecosystems, establish monitoring programs. Seasonal fluctuations, cumulative effects, and the possibility of community recovery over time can all be captured by longitudinal research. Examine how exposure to pesticides affects algal assemblages at the community level. A more thorough understanding of ecosystem dynamics will result from knowing how various species interact and respond as a community. Examine how sensitive different pesticide classes are to different types of algae. This study can help discover significant indicator species and clarify the variables affecting the various reactions of different algae taxa. Analyse how pesticides interact with stresses brought on by climate change, such as shifting precipitation patterns and temperature regimes. It is essential to comprehend how these elements work together to affect algal communities in order to forecast future ecological scenarios. Examine the detoxification processes and metabolic pathways that algae use when exposed to pesticides. The results of this study assist in clarifying the innate resilience of some species and direct the creation of more focused conservation plans. Examine the relationship that exists between microbial populations and algae in relation to pesticide exposure. Gaining knowledge about how pesticides affect microbial-algal interactions can help us understand how ecosystems work more broadly. Examine the possible connections between pesticides and microplastics in aquatic settings. A careful investigation is necessary to fully understand the combined effects of these stressors on algal communities and the ensuing ramifications for higher trophic levels. Promote studies on the creation and performance of environmentally friendly substitutes for conventional pesticides. In order to lessen the ecological impact on algal communities, this involves investigating the possibilities of biopesticides, integrated pest management techniques, and environmentally friendly methods. Examine the effects of pesticides on algal communities from an ecosystem perspective, taking into account the ripple effects on higher trophic levels, nutrient cycling, and the resilience of the ecosystem as a whole. For conservation and management planning to be effective, a holistic approach is essential. Place a focus on studies that take into account the social and ecological aspects of pesticide usage. An understanding of the relationships between ecological processes and human activity can inform sustainable and socially responsible pesticide management techniques. The scientific community can further efforts to maintain and manage aquatic ecosystems sustainably and contribute to a more thorough understanding of pesticide-algal interactions by addressing these research recommendations.

15. Conclusion
Numerous investigators use single algal species toxicity testing with in laboratory to identify the toxicity of such a wide range of pesticide residues introduced into aquatic environment. Such types of tests illustrate the need for strategies which not only identify contaminant damage and yet also recognize biochemical as well as physiological impairment. Based on the current review, a significant quantity of chemical contaminants from industry, urbanization, as well as agricultural practices have been entering aquatic environment, posing a significant potential danger to algal diversity, fish as well as other aquatic biota. Pesticides/insecticides have a negative impact upon that organism's algal physiology, causing tissue injury, developmental delay, genotoxicity, procreative disruption, and tissue biomagnification. Pesticides seem to be hazardous and lead to structural changes in non - target organisms such as biodiversity, according to experiments conducted. Hence, efforts made are required to reduce the application of synthetic agrochemicals like pesticides/herbicides. Organic agriculture can help reduce pesticide contamination by implementing biopesticides/bioherbicides encroachment strategies. Aside from frequent biomonitoring to understand the hazardous situations posed by researcher, it is necessary to conduct investigation that will provide early alerts of pesticide contamination of aquatic systems. Hence, research into early warning indicators is critical for controlling and minimizing the hazards induced by them on non-target life forms.

,,"Abstract
Over the years, bioaccumulation of hazardous chemicals in the food chain has become a critical issue, resulting in numerous health risks. Environmental mitigation aims to clean up contaminated sites and eliminate hazardous materials from the air, water, or soil to restore the site to its original and safe condition. Pesticides constitute one of the most dangerous environmental pollutants which are generally used to increase crop production. Addressing the removal or treatment of pesticides has become pivotal in mitigating environmental threats. Diverse remediation methods are employed to protect the environment and public health. Graphene-based materials have emerged as promising candidates with exceptional properties, including excellent adsorption capacity due to their high surface area, strong hydrophilicity, and tunable properties. Owing to these properties, they have been attracting major research attention in the field of design and fabrication of materials for the mitigation of pesticides from the environment such as from contaminated food, water and other samples. Various physical, chemical and biological extraction techniques are adopted to remove pesticides. This review article provides an insight into the potential role of graphene-based materials in the environmental remediation of pesticides. We have focused on the removal of Organophosphates, Organochlorines, Carbamates and Pyrethroids present in water, fruit, vegetable and other samples, highlighting the urgent need for environmental remediation. While graphene-based materials hold potential for pesticide remediation, addressing challenges in scalable production, assessing long-term sustainability, and mitigating potential environmental impacts are critical steps for successful large-scale applications."
,,"1. Introduction
As industrialization and human activities continue to grow, hazardous substances are being released into landfills, industries, and private properties, posing threats to the environment and human health. This has become a global concern, and new technologies are being explored to combat contamination in air, water, and soil. Environmental remediation refers to the process of the removal or treatment of pollutants or hazardous materials from soil, water and air or cleaning up contaminated environmental sites and restoring them to their original or acceptable state [1].

Environmental remediation is essential in restoring the natural environment by removing harmful pollutants from various sources, such as soil and water, to protect public health and the environment. These hazardous pollutants include insecticides, herbicides, heavy metals, oil spills, poisonous gases, industrial effluents, sewage, and organic compounds. However, pollutant capture and degradation can be difficult due to the complex mixture of compounds and low reactivity. Therefore, there is a need for ecologically friendly and sustainable materials and approaches in environmental remediation. Environmental remediation can be performed at various scales, from small contaminated sites to large-scale industrial sites, and it often requires the involvement of multidisciplinary teams of experts [2].

Pesticides are one of the major pollutants that can persist in the environment for a long time depending on factors such as their chemical properties, soil type, temperature, and rainfall [[3], [4], [5]]. These are chemical substances essential in improving crop yields. These are used to kill, repel, or control pests such as insects, rodents, fungus, and weeds [3]. The environmental fate of pesticides refers to their behavior in the environment, including their transformation, movement, metabolism, and degradation. Pesticides can undergo various environmental fate processes, including photolysis, hydrolysis, volatilization, leaching, and biodegradation and lead to their adverse effects in the food chain as shown in Fig. 1. While pesticides have been instrumental in enhancing food production and controlling disease vectors, their widespread use has led to environmental contamination that poses a serious threat to human health as well as the environment as a whole. Pesticides can enter the environment through various pathways, including agricultural runoff, atmospheric deposition, and direct application [6,7]. The environmental repercussions of pesticides, particularly their potential to pollute soil, water, air, and cropland, are of significant scientific concern. Therefore, its remediation involves the use of different strategies to mitigate the effects of pesticide contamination on the environment [8,9].
"
,,"For the safeguard of the environment as well as public health, there are various environmental remediation techniques for pesticides, including physical, chemical, and biological [11,12]. The choice of remediation technique again relies on several factors like, type of pesticide as well as its concentration in the specific sample, nature of the contaminated medium [13]. However, the complex nature of pesticide captures and degradation, caused by the combination of different substances, their tendency to evaporate quickly, and low reactivity, makes it challenging to deal with them. As a result, there is an increasing demand for sustainable and environmentally friendly materials.

Graphene-based materials have shown promising potential toward the remediation of pesticides owing to their unique physicochemical properties. These properties include high surface area imparting extraordinary adsorption capacity, and strong reactivity [14,15]. Several studies have demonstrated that graphene-based materials possess adsorption capacity of usually higher than other materials, such as activated carbon, due to their extremely large surface area and numerous π-bonds, which can get involved in several types of interactions with the pesticide molecules [16]. Moreover, these materials are known to exhibit excellent photocatalytic properties [17,18], which find great application in the degradation of several pesticides in water and soil. Under UV or visible light, these materials can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can break down the pesticide molecules into harmless products. In addition, graphene-based products have significantly good electrical conductivity and can be used as electrodes for the electrochemical degradation of pesticides. When a voltage is applied, the electrodes can generate ROS, breaking down the pesticide molecules. The graphene oxide membrane has excellent water permeability and can effectively remove pesticides from water through size exclusion, adsorption, and electrostatic repulsion [19,20].

This literature reported various physical, chemical, electrochemical and biological methods involved in pesticide remediation. Each method has advantages and disadvantages and can be used alone or in combination with other strategies for effective pesticide remediation. This review article makes a novel attempt to provide insight into the potential role of various graphene-based materials towards the environmental remediation from pesticides.

2. Types of pesticides and their harmful effects
Pesticides are chemicals that are used to repel or prevent or kill or control the growth of pests that harm crops, livestock, and human health. They are common in agriculture, homes, offices, gardens, and public health initiatives. Pesticides are categorized according to their use towards targets, chemical structure, and toxicity. Certain pesticides are dangerous to people and non-target creatures, while others are not. There are various ways of classifying the types of pesticides depending on a different basis of classification [21].

2.1. On the basis of their targets
Pesticides are classed based on the pest species which they are intended to repel or kill and are given unique names to reflect their actions. The pesticide category names are derived from the Latin word “cide” meaning killer and is named after the specific target pest [22]. The major types of pesticides falling in this category are listed below:

2.1.1. Insecticides
Insecticides are used to repel or kill insects that cause agricultural damage and disease transmission. They function by interfering with the neurological system, breathing system, or growth and development of insects. Organophosphates, organochlorines, carbamates and pyrethroids are some common insecticides. Organophosphates and carbamates decrease the function of cholinesterase, an enzyme that controls nerve impulse transmission, causing paralysis and death in insects. Pyrethroids replicate the actions of natural pesticides generated from chrysanthemum flowers, pyrethrins, by binding to sodium channels in insect nerve cells, inducing excitation and paralysis. Neonicotinoids paralyze and kill insects by binding to their nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Organochlorines, such as DDT, were once widely utilized but are now banned in many countries due to their persistence in the environment [8,23].

2.1.2. Herbicides
Herbicides are used to control weeds that compete with crops for nutrients, water, and sunlight. They work by inhibiting the activity of enzymes involved in plant growth and metabolism or disrupting the structure and function of plant cell membranes. Some common herbicides are glyphosate, 2, 4-D, atrazine, paraquat, and dicamba. Glyphosate inhibits the activity of EPSP synthase, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids, leading to the accumulation of toxic intermediates and the death of plants. 2, 4-D mimics the effects of auxin, a plant hormone that regulates growth and development, leading to abnormal growth and death of plants. Atrazine inhibits the activity of photosystem II, a complex of proteins involved in photosynthesis, leading to the production of ROS and the death of plants. Paraquat and dicamba disrupt the integrity of plant cell membranes, leading to the leakage of cellular contents and the death of plants [4,23].

2.1.3. Fungicides
Fungicides are used to prevent or control growth of fungi that cause diseases in crops, trees, and animals. They work by interfering with the metabolism or cell division of fungi or disrupting the integrity of fungal cell membranes. Some common fungicides are azoles, strobilurins, benzimidazoles, and copper-based compounds. Azoles inhibit the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes, leading to the disruption of membrane function and the death of fungi. Strobilurins is known for inhibition ofcomplex III activity in the transport chain of mitochondrial electron, that leads to the production of ROS and the death of fungi. Benzimidazoles inhibit the activity of tubulin, a protein involved in the formation of microtubules, leading to the disruption of cell division and death of fungi. Copper-based compounds disrupt the integrity of fungal cell membranes, leading to the leakage of cellular contents and the death of fungi [23].

2.1.4. Bactericides
Bactericides are used to prevent the growth of bacteria on crops, plants, and other surfaces. While bactericides effectively control bacterial infections, they can also harm the environment, human health, and non-target organisms. Bactericides can contaminate soil, water, and air, leading to environmental pollution. Bactericides can leave residues on crops that are consumed by humans and animals. These residues can be toxic and can be potential cause of cancer, congenital disabilities, and several neurological disorders. Bactericides can also harm various non-target species, like beneficial bacteria, birds, insects, and mammals, which may be important for soil health, pollination, pest control, and other ecosystem services. Exposure to bactericides can also be a reason for severe health problems in humans, such as respiratory problems, skin irritation, neurological disorders, etc. [23].

2.1.5. Rodenticides
Rodenticides are used to repel or inhibit rodents, such as mice and rats, that damage crops, structures, and public health. They work by disrupting the nervous system, respiratory system, or blood clotting of rodents, leading to internal bleeding and eventual death. However, rodenticides can also have harmful side effects on humans and other animals. These can also cause accidental ingestion if not used and stored properly [23].

2.2. On the basis of biodegradability
Biodegradability is the ability of pesticides to decompose naturally. It is a crucial characteristic that governs how they will behave and be distributed in the environment. Biodegradation refers to the breakdown of complex organic compounds into simple molecules, like, water, carbon dioxide, and other substances, by microorganisms. Biodegradation of pesticides can take place in different environmental settings, such as soil, water, or air, depending on their chemical features and surrounding conditions. Pesticides that are easily biodegradable can be broken down swiftly by microorganisms, while those that are resistant can persist in the environment for prolonged periods and accumulate in the food chain.

2.2.1. Biodegradable pesticides
Biodegradable pesticides refer to chemicals that can be decomposed into harmless substances by natural processes such as water, sunlight, and microorganisms. These pesticides are environmentally friendly because they do not stay in the environment and do not accumulate in the food chain. Compared to traditional pesticides, biodegradable pesticides are less harmful to non-target organisms like birds, bees, and other wildlife. Examples of biodegradable pesticides include neem oil, pyrethrins, and spinosad derived from plants or microorganisms. While biodegradable pesticides are generally considered safe for humans and the environment, incorrect use can still pose a risk to beneficial insects and other non-target organisms. Therefore, the environmental impact of pesticides is strongly influenced by their biodegradability [22,24].

2.2.2. Non-biodegradable pesticides
Pesticides that are not easily broken down by natural processes and can last for extended periods of time are known as non-biodegradable pesticides. Typically, these pesticides are synthetic compounds created to be stable and long-lasting to offer extended protection against pests. Examples of non-biodegradable pesticides include DDT and chlordane, which are organochlorines, as well as malathion and parathion, which are organophosphates. They are highly toxic to insects and other living beings and can also be dangerous to human health. They can accumulate in the environment and the food chain, leading to severe, long-term effects on ecosystems and human health.

Overall, use of pesticides has become a complex issue that involves balancing the need to control pests and protect crops with the need to minimize the environmental as well as human health effects of these chemicals. By understanding the different types of pesticides on the basis of biodegradability and other factors, we can make informed decisions about the most appropriate pest management strategies for different situations. We must also continue to develop and promote alternative pest management strategies that are environmentally sustainable and socially equitable.

2.3. On the basis of chemical composition
Pesticides may be chemical or biological compounds which can be derived from plant or plant products. The study of the classification of pesticides on the basis of their chemical composition is quite important as their chemical buildup decides the amount of toxic and harmful components present in a pesticide which can cause huge damage to our environment. There are several types of pesticides based on chemical composition as shown in Table 1, and they have different modes of action and toxicity levels. These include Organophosphates, Organochlorines, Carbamate, Pyrethroid and Pyrethrin which are shown in Fig. 2 [8,24,25]."
,,"2.3.1. Organophosphates
Organophosphates (OP) pesticides with the general structure Odouble bondP(OR)3 and are basically esters derived from phosphoric acid; this is used as an insecticide, especially on fruits and vegetables. The chemical structure comprises of a central phosphate molecule attached to alkyl or aromatic substituents [26]. OPs are extensively used in various products such as in plasticizers, flame retardants, engine oil, etc. They are widely used in textile, electronic, agriculture and furniture industries because of their low cost of production and high compatibility with various polymers, but there are various harmful effects of OPs. Most of the OPs are neurotoxic and affect the nervous system due to inhibition of the function of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme in various nerve cells. Due to their potential for absorption by ingestion, inhalation, and cutaneous absorption, OPs are one of the most prevalent causes of poisoning in living things globally [27]. Prolonged OPs exposure can lead to memory loss, severe depression and impairment of embryonic development, thyroid hormones, and various ill-effects on the neurological systems of living organisms.

2.3.2. Organochlorines
Organochlorine pesticide (OCP) is a synthetic chemical pesticide which is very toxic, poisonous and persistent. OCPs were commonly used earlier as an effective mosquito killer, but now it is banned in many countries because of their ill impact on the health of living organisms and the environment OCPs belong to four structural classes: diphenyl aliphatics, cyclodienes, cyclohexanes, and polychloroterpenes. In OCPs, there is a very strong bond between carbon and chlorine which makes them soluble in fats and insoluble in water which further leaches the pesticide when it rains and causes bioaccumulation of toxic substances because of its persistent nature [28]. Along with bioaccumulation, exposure to OCPs for a longer duration can cause central nervous system depression, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other breathing problems.

2.3.3. Carbamates
Carbamate pesticides are basically carbamic acid-derived organic compounds that is derived from, which are usually obtained when one or more hydrogen atoms in carbamic acid are replaced by other organic moieties [29]. Carbamates can be synthesized by the alcoholysis of chloroformamides and ammonium carbamate can be prepared by the treatment of ammonia with carbon dioxide. Ammonium carbamate is used as an intermediate for the synthesis of urea. Carbamates are also used as wood and paint preservatives and in cosmetics. Still, the Carbamate pesticide is quite harmful and dangerous because it is very poisonous and deactivates the AChE enzyme, which causes cholinergic poisoning. It also attacks the melatonin receptors present in the human body [30]. It also adversely impacts the renal, neurological, reproductive, metabolic and immune systems in both humans and animals.

2.3.4. Pyrethroids and pyrethrins
Pyrethroid is an organic substance that resembles the natural pyrethrins produced by the pyrethrum flower. Most pyrethroids are derivatives of 2, 2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid. Allethrin was the first synthesized pyrethroid [31]. Pyrethroids can be generally undergo dissociation in sunlight and atmosphere in a day or two. However, they can persist for some time when associated with sediment. They are found in effluents at levels which are lethal to invertebrates [32]. Pyrethroids at lower levels are harmless to human beings as they are poorly absorbed by human skin but harmful to insects and fishes. Generally, the symptoms of pyrethroid poisoning are paresthesia, nausea, coma, pulmonary edema, vomiting, and so on.

On the other hand, pyrethrins are organic compounds derived from Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium. They exhibit insect-repellent as well as insecticidal properties. Compared to OPPs and OCPs, pyrethrins are considered a better choice of pesticide due to their lower toxicity and persistence [33]. They selectively kill targeted insects without harming mammals, due to the increased sensitivity of insect nerves, less absorption via mammalian skin, and effective hepatic metabolism in mammals. However, these can be harmful to mammals, causing toxicity and poisoning. Inhalation and skin absorption in humans can lead to chronic toxicity, allergic reactions, itching, and burning. Additionally, excessive use of pyrethrins can negatively impact the environment through bioaccumulation in aquatic and terrestrial organisms [34].

3. GRAPHENE-BASED materials
Graphene is a two-dimensional material composed of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal honeycomb lattice. It has exceptional properties such as high thermal conductivity, excellent electrical conductivity and mechanical properties, significant surface area, and specific magnetism. It has attracted significant scientific attention in various fields, including solar cells, field-effect transistors, sensors, supercapacitors, and transparent electrodes. Its chemical properties, large surface area, and unique geometry make it particularly promising for environmental pollution control and energy-related applications, which have generated interest among environmentalists [36,37]. Efforts are being made to modify the surface of graphene by attaching nanoparticles or other materials in various arrangements, resulting in unique properties and improved performance. These graphene-based materials have potential applications in memory devices, molecular imaging, biomedical science, drug delivery, pollution control, and energy development [38].

3.1. Types of graphene based materials
There are several materials based on graphene, which can be produced by incorporating graphene into other materials or by manipulating its structure [[38], [39], [40], [41]]. Some of the common graphene-based materials are:
a)
Graphene oxide (GO): It is a derivative of graphene that comprises various oxygen containing functional like, carboxyl (-COOH), hydroxyl (-OH), and epoxy (–COC–) groups. It is produced by oxidizing graphene using strong acids. It is easily dispersible in water and easily functionalized, making it useful for several applications such as water purification, catalysis, energy storage, biosensors and biomedicine [19,20]. Various researches utilized modified graphene oxide bonded with other materials in pesticide extractions in order to improve its sorption properties [[42], [43], [44]].

b)
Reduced graphene oxide (rGO): It is obtained by reducing GO, which removes oxygen-containing functional groups. It restores the electrical conductivity of graphene and is more conductive than GO. rGO is used in environmental remediation, optical sensors, electronic devices and energy storage [45]. Research including rGO coated with ZnO nanocomposites shows improved adsorption efficiency for the extraction of pesticides [46].

c)
Graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs): GNPs are nanoscale particles with a thickness of 5–10 nm and varying sizes up to 50 μm. They are cheaper and easier to produce than single-layered graphene and carbon nanotubes. GNPs consist of platelet-shaped graphene sheets, offering a high surface area per unit mass compared to graphite and carbon nanotubes. Due to these features, GNPs are useful in diverse research areas, including adsorption and solid phase extraction for analytical purposes. They can be used as fillers in composites to improve mechanical and electrical properties [47,48].

d)
Graphene aerogels: They are lightweight materials with high porosity, mechanical strength and surface area, making them useful for energy storage, catalysis, and environmental remediation. These are made by freeze-drying a solution of graphene oxide. In a recent study, Sun et al. synthesized three-dimensional graphene aerogel (3D-GA) from graphene oxides and utilized it to determine OPPs [49]. The other example of such aerogel for extracting pesticides includes magnetic 3D-G-Fe3O4 [50].

e)
Graphene-based composites: They are materials in which graphene is combined with other materials such as polymers, metals, or ceramics. Graphene-based composites have improved mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties [51]. They are used in a wide range of applications such as aerospace, automotive, sensors, energy storage and electronics [38,[52], [53], [54]]. These can be classified as magnetic and non-magnetic. Various studies have proved that the magnetic graphene-based nanocomposites can be utilized as adsorbent in the determination and extraction of different pesticides. For instance, graphene-based tetraethoxysilane-methyltrimethoxysilane sol-gel hybrid magnetic nanocomposite (Fe3O4@G-TEOS-MTMOS) can be used for the determination of OPPs [55].


These are just a few examples of graphene-based materials. The versatility of graphene has led to the development of many other types of graphene-based materials, and their potential applications are still being explored.

Graphene-based materials have great potential for environmental remediation of pesticides due to their exceptional properties and versatility. The unique structure allows graphene-based materials to adsorb and remove a variety of pollutants, including pesticides, from contaminated water and soil. One of the main advantages of graphene-based materials for pesticide remediation is their high adsorption capacity. Studies have shown that GO and rGO can adsorb a wide range of pesticides, including glyphosate, atrazine, and carbendazim, with high efficiency. The adsorption process is attributed to the strong π-π stacking interaction between the graphene-based materials and the pesticide molecules. Another advantage of graphene-based materials is their strong chemical stability, which allows them to maintain their structural integrity even under harsh environmental conditions. This property makes them an ideal candidate for long-term use in environmental remediation applications. These materials can also be easily synthesized and modified to enhance their adsorption properties [[14], [15], [16],[56], [57], [58], [59], [60]]. Functionalizing graphene-based materials with different groups can increase their selectivity towards specific pesticides, making them more effective in removing target pollutants. For example, the integration of amine-modified graphene membrane polyamide with a polysulfone (PSf) support significantly enhances the membrane functionality and characteristics [61]. Consequently, this integration proves to be promising for application in the wastewater treatment industry.

This review will cover various graphene-based materials in showing great potential as effective and sustainable candidates for the environmental remediation of pesticides. However, more research is needed to fully understand their performance in real-world applications and their potential environmental impact.

3.2. Fabrication of graphene based materials
Graphene is a one-atom-thick layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice. There are two main categories in terms of synthesizing graphene as single-layer graphene (SLG), bilayer graphene, or few-layer graphene (FLG): top-down and bottom-up approaches. Several methods have been discovered to obtain graphene, including chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition, and chemical synthesis. Fabrication of graphene-based materials involves several methods, each with its advantages and limitations. As a result, there is a growing demand for the development of techniques that can produce graphene in large quantities while maintaining high quality [62].

Several methods for graphene-based materials fabrication are listed below:
a)
Mechanical exfoliation: It is one of the earliest methods used to fabricate graphene-based materials. In this method, graphene-based materials are obtained from graphite through a process that involves repeatedly removing graphene layers using adhesive tape. This method is slow and only yields small amounts of graphene [63].

b)
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD): The CVD method involves the introduction of a carbon-containing gas into a furnace that is kept at high temperatures. This leads to the decomposition of the gas, resulting in the formation of graphene on a substrate made of a metal catalyst. CVD is a technique that enables the production of graphene films on a large scale. This method allows for the production of large-area graphene films with high quality, but it requires specialized equipment and skilled personnel [64].

c)
Reduced graphene oxide (rGO): It involves oxidizing graphite to form graphene oxide, followed by chemical or thermal reduction to produce rGO. This technique allows for the production of a large quantity of graphene sheets. The excellent properties of graphene can be partly regenerated by the reduction of the oxygen functional groups of GO. However, the quality of the resulting material is not as high as pristine graphene [65].

d)
Graphene composites: When graphene is combined with polymers, metals, or ceramics, it can create composites that exhibit improved strength, conductivity, and lightweight properties. It is a common method to prepare graphene-polymer composites, which involves fully exfoliating graphite and achieving a molecular-level dispersion of chemically modified graphene sheets within polymer matrices. This approach ensures that the individual graphene sheets are well-dispersed and integrated into the polymer host. Graphene oxide sheets are typically only dispersible in water, making them incompatible with most organic polymers. Furthermore, graphene oxide lacks electrical conductivity, unlike graphite, limiting its usefulness for conductive nanocomposites. However, chemical reduction can enhance the electrical conductivity of graphite oxide by restoring a graphitic network [66].


The selection of a specific method for producing graphene-based materials is reliant on the intended usage and the specific properties that the resulting material should possess. As technology advances, the techniques for producing graphene-based materials are also evolving. There are continuously emerging new methods to fabricate such materials. The selection of a particular method is determined by the intended application and the desired properties of the resulting material.

4. Extraction methods adopted for removal of pesticides
Pesticides are essential in agriculture to control pests and achieve maximum crop production. Nevertheless, excessive use and misuse of pesticides can cause health and environmental hazards. Toxic residues from pesticides can infiltrate the food chain via contaminated crops and water sources, causing harm to human well-being and the ecosystem. Hence, it is essential to eliminate pesticides from the food supply and the surroundings in order to guarantee the safety of food and the preservation of the environment. Several methods can be adopted to remove pesticides from contaminated sources, such as water, soil, and food. These include physical, heat treatment, chemical, biological, adsorption, and membrane filtration methods. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of method depends on the type of pesticide, the level of contamination, and the specific application [8].

4.1. Physical methods
Physical methods involve utilizing physical processes like washing, soaking, and scrubbing to eliminate pesticides from the surface of fruits and vegetables. Running water alone can eliminate up to 75% of pesticide residues. The effectiveness of washing can be enhanced by using ultrasonic waves and high-pressure water. A vinegar solution can be used to soak fruits and vegetables, breaking down the wax and removing surface contaminants. Scrubbing with a brush is also useful in removing pesticide residues. Physical removal techniques involve heat treatment, membrane filtration, and adsorption to separate the pesticides from the contaminated medium. Physical methods are an excellent option for household use since they are easy, inexpensive, and non-toxic [67].

4.1.1. Heat treatment
Heat treatment is a method used to eliminate pesticides by exposing them to high temperatures. This approach is particularly useful for removing pesticides that are sensitive to heat. Common heat treatment methods for pesticide removal include blanching, steaming, and boiling. Blanching involves dipping fruits and vegetables in boiling water briefly, then immediately cooling them in ice water. Steaming uses steam to heat the fruits and vegetables, while boiling uses boiling water to cook them. While heat treatment effectively removes pesticides from food, it can impact its nutritional content and quality [68,69].

4.1.2. Adsorption method
Adsorption methods are used to eliminate pesticides from water by utilizing adsorbents. Adsorbents such as activated carbon, zeolites, and clays strongly attract pesticides and can adsorb them by pulling them towards their surface. The pesticides are then absorbed onto the surface of the material, which can be removed from the water. Activated carbon is often used for the removal of pesticides from water, while zeolites and clays are more commonly used for removing pesticides from soil.

4.1.3. Membrane filtration
Membrane filtration is a technique that utilizes membranes to extract pesticides from contaminated water sources. Membranes with varying pore sizes can be employed to filter out pesticides based on their size and molecular weight. Examples of commonly used membrane filtration methods for pesticide removal include ultrafiltration and nanofiltration. Ultrafiltration uses membranes with pore sizes ranging from 0.001 to 0.1 μm, while nanofiltration uses membranes with pore sizes ranging from 0.001 to 0.01 μm [70]. Although membrane filtration effectively removes pesticides from water sources, it can be expensive and requires specialized equipment [67,71,72].

4.2. Chemical methods
Chemical methods are used to eliminate pesticides from food and the environment by using chemical substances such as hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite, and ozone. Solvents like methanol, acetone, and ethyl acetate are also used to dissolve and extract pesticides. These chemicals break down the molecular structure of pesticides, making them harmless. For example, hydrogen peroxide is commonly used to remove pesticides from fruits and vegetables, while sodium hypochlorite is used to purify water sources contaminated with pesticides. Ozone gas is used to treat water sources contaminated with pesticides.

4.3. Electrochemical methods
In recent years, electrochemical methods have become increasingly popular for removing pesticides from water because of their affordability and effectiveness. These methods utilize electrical energy to oxidize or reduce the target compounds. Examples of electrochemical methods include electrochemical oxidation, electrochemical reduction, and electrocoagulation. Pesticides can be transformed into less harmful substances or completely mineralized into carbon dioxide and water through electrochemical oxidation or reduction. One advantage of electrochemical methods is that they can operate at ambient temperatures and pressures. However, to achieve high efficiency and minimize the formation of by-products, optimizing reaction conditions, electrode materials, and electrode configurations [73,74].

4.4. Biological methods
Biological methods for eliminating pesticides involve the use of living organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, algae, and plants. Bioremediation is a common method that uses microorganisms to break down pesticides into harmless substances. This approach can be effective for removing specific types of pesticides. Bioremediation shows promise as a viable alternative to conventional physical and chemical remediation methods, due to its cost-effectiveness and environmentally friendly nature. Another biological method involves the use of plants such as sunflowers, corn, and willows, which can absorb and metabolize pesticides, removing them from the soil. There is a pressing need for advanced studies utilizing proteomics and genomic tools to identify key genes responsible for pesticide degradation. These genes can then be utilized for the development of transgenic microalgae, enabling more efficient bioremediation of pesticides [25,75,76].

The development of new and innovative methods for pesticide removal from water sources is essential for mitigating the adverse impacts of pesticides on public health and environment.

5. Removal of organophosphates
Various methods and techniques are applied and identified by the researchers for the determination of OPs as their presence is found in high levels in food products and environmental water resources because of its wide use.

5.1. From water samples
As per reported information, the EU Commission established the MRL for all the pesticides and maximum admissible concentration of single compound as 0.5 and 0.1 ugL−1, respectively.

The researchers Razmi and Jabbari developed a highly efficient MSPE method coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography with UV (HPLC-UV) to accurately estimate OPPs in environmental water samples [77]. The graphene-carbon nanotube-Fe3O4 (G-CNT-Fe3O4) ternary nanocomposite was synthesized through a simple solvothermal process. Key factors such as extraction efficiency, extraction time, and desorption behavior were thoroughly studied. The results exhibited a wide dynamic linear range of 0.005–200 ng mL−1, good linearity (R2 ∼ 0.9955), and low detection limits ranging from 1.4 to 11 pg mL−1. The method achieved high enrichment factors ranging from 930 to 1510. Overall, the developed method proves to be suitable for precisely monitoring OPPs at trace levels in environmental water samples.

Yang and co-workers added a new adsorbent, graphene oxide hybrid nanocomposite UiO-67/GO [78]. It demonstrated a remarkable maximum adsorption capacity of approximately 2.855 mmol (482.69 mg) g−1 for glyphosate at pH 4, surpassing the performance of most GO-based adsorbents. Furthermore, UiO-67/GO exhibited excellent adsorption capabilities towards OPPs over a pH range of 2–8. The presence of abundant Zr–OH groups on the surface of GO, combined with the large available surface area of GO, enhanced the adsorption of targeted OPPs, resulting in an amplified adsorption capacity towards glyphosate. These experimental findings suggested that UiO-67/GO held great potential as a promising adsorbent for the efficient removal of OPPs while purifying contaminated water.

Nodeh et al. fabricated a novel magnetic graphene-based tetraethoxysilane-methyltrimethoxysilane sol-gel hybrid magnetic nanocomposite (Fe3O4@G-TEOS-MTMOS) [55]. Magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) was used for the determination of OPPs from multiple water samples. The proposed mechanism for OPPs adsorption using Fe3O4@G-TEOS-MTMOS is shown in Fig. 3. The nanocomposite showed a good adsorption capacity of 54.4–76.3 mg/g towards the targeted OPPs. High extraction recoveries ranging from 83 to 105% for OPPs from various water samples using Gas Chromatography (GC) analysis were obtained. These findings suggest that the synthesized graphene-based nanocomposite showed great potential as adsorbent for OPPs analysis."
,,"Suo et al. developed an adsorbent from sieve-like corn straw cellulose and graphene oxide composites (ACCE/G) for the eradication of various OPs from water [79]. Experimental data showed that the it has a much higher adsorption capacity (152.5 mg/g) towards various OPPs than the existing common sorbents. The adsorption mechanism depends on the electron-donating ability of S and P atoms. As per the Langmuir model, the adsorption efficiency of ACCE/G is more than 80% even after eight times of recycling, making it suitable from an environmental perspective.

In a research by Liu et al. Graphene Coated Silica (GCS) was used as a highly efficient sorbent for the adsorption of eleven different OPPs from water samples [80]. The synthesis was done by reducing exfoliated GO on the acid-treated silica. It was further characterized using various techniques such as XRD, BET, TGA, FT-IR, Raman spectroscopy and so on. The result showed that the adsorption of nine out of eleven OPPs was above 95% and relative standard deviation (RSD) was under 5%. Overall, GCS proves to be a highly effective, efficient, stable, easy to process, and consistent adsorbent for residual OPPs in water.

Wang et al. processed a novel magnetic nanocomposite for the extraction of various OPs from river and groundwater by MSPE [81]. The magnetic nanocomposite was synthesized by coating Fe3O4 with SiO2 and then bonded with GO under the catalytic effect of hydrazine hydrate. It was characterized by GC with flame photometric detection, IR and various other techniques. It detected OPPs in a concentration range of 0.1 mg/L to 5 mg/L while achieving a linear response for malathion and chlorpyrifos in the concentration range of 0.05 mg/L to 5 mg/L under optimum conditions. Hence, this method is easy, efficient and shows good precision towards the removal of OPs from water samples.

Another work by Jabbari et al. discusses ceramic-magnetic graphene (C-G/Fe3O4) NPs based solid phase microextraction (SPME) fiber coated on a glass tube [82]. The evaluation of the analytical applications of the prepared material was done through the extraction and determination of OPs from water samples. Under optimal conditions, linear response was observed in the concentration range of 0.05–400 μg L−1, and determination coefficients (R2) exceeded 0.9944 for the analytes. These OPPs have detection limit in the range of 5 ng/L to 60 ng/L. The main advantage of this method is the excellent reproducibility, which means that a new fabricated fiber can replace the old one without any recalibration. Overall, this method is very cheap, efficient in terms of extraction capability, and simple in terms of fiber preparation.

Aladaghlo et al. developed an ultrasound-assisted dispersive SPE method. They used mesoporous nanosorbent composed of Palladium, graphene and silica (M S/G@-SH@Pd (II)) [83]. It was used to extract and determine OPPs from various water samples. Under optimal conditions, this technique provides good repeatability with RSD less than 4.6%, excellent extraction capacity with preconcentration factor (PF) in the range of 472–478, and high recovery (93–94%) for various OPPs. This nanosorbent is physically and chemically stable with recyclability of at least five times without any considerable activity loss.

Another method which is developed by Sun et al. in which a 3D-GA was fabricated by chemically reducing the GOs aqueous solution with ethylenediamine by utilizing a simple water-bath method [49]. It was followed by freeze drying treatment and SPE cartridge packing for the determination of six types of OPPs. Due to the porosity and large surface area, 3D-GA acts as a very efficient adsorbent for various OPPs in environmental water samples. The method showed a linear response between 0.5 and 500 μg L−1 and a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.9990–0.9998. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for these OPPs came in the range of 0.1–0.6 μg L−1 and 0.1–1.97 μg L−1 respectively, with accuracy between 94% and 104% and RSDs of 1–6 %. Therefore, this method can be efficiently used to determine and extract various OPs from different environmental water samples involving tap water, drinking water, river water and lake water.

5.2. From fruit and water samples
Nasiri et al. developed a new MSPE adsorbent, magnetic GO coated with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA@MGO nanocomposite) for the removal of five OPPs from apple juice and water bodies by GC-MS analysis [42]. MGO nanocomposite was prepared from graphene powder using Modified Hummers Method or Co-precipitation Method. Then on adding the pre-prepared PVA aqueous solution (5%) to MGO suspension (0.07 g), the mixed solution was sonicated for an hour at 400 W power. And on applying the magnetic field, the resulting solid PVA@MGO nanocomposite film was obtained, which then washed with ethanol and dried at 60 °C. MSPE optimization was carried out using five standard OPP samples by aiming the extraction parameters shown in Fig. 4 for analyzing real samples and assess the effectiveness of the newly developed MSPE adsorbent in sorbing OPPs. The MSPE-GC-MS method exhibited a dynamic range for OPs in the concentration range of 0.07–500 ng mL−1. The detection limits were determined to be in between 20 and 80 pg mL−1. The precisions were found to be between 3 and 8 %, respectively. When analyzing real water samples from water bodies and apple juice contaminated with pesticides, the relative recoveries were between 94.5% and 107.1%, with RSDs ranging from 2.6% to 6.5%. These findings indicate that it is a suitable method for concurrent identification and efficient analysis of OPs residues."
,,"Xue et al. developed a graphene-nafion matrix modified glassy carbon electrode (Graphene-Nafion/GCE) for the determination of nitroaromatic OPs (methyl parathion, paraoxon, and fenitrothion) using electrochemical techniques [84]. They fabricated the electrochemical sensor by using the graphene–nafion matrix as sorbent. The researchers took methyl parathion as a model of OPs for its removal by following the analytical procedures which were done by the adsorption of methyl parathion and the stripping voltammetry determination. Under optimal conditions, the response current in stripping voltammetry showed a linear correlation with the concentration of methyl parathion. This correlation was observed within 0.02–20 μg/mL with a LOD as 1.6 ng/ml for methyl parathion. As a result, the graphene was characterized as highly beneficial to have a high surface area on the electrode. After modifications with Graphene-nafion matrix the surface of the GCE became rough and electrode effective surface area was increased and the deposition of OPs also increased.

In 2017, another adsorbent was introduced by Akbarzade S. and coworkers [85]. The adsorbent was Fe-reduced GO quantum dots (rGOQDs@Fe) todetermine OPs in fruit and water test samples. The preparation of rGOQDs@Fe was done by the reduction of GO to graphene nanosheets to get the desired product. The method used for extraction was Magnetic DSPME. The authors concluded that the method demonstrated a wide linear dynamic range under the optimal conditions, with R2 values ranging from 0.9959 to 0.9991. The detection limit was below 0.07 ng/mL, while the inter-day and intra-day RSDs (n = 5) were 8.6% and 4.7%, respectively. It was used to extract and determine OPPs in real water samples and fruit juice (specifically grape and apple juice) samples. The obtained samples showed 82.9%–113.2% relative recoveries, with RSD value less than 5.8% for the real samples. Thus, the method showcased a wide linear dynamic range, low detection limits, and excellent precision, making it suitable for extracting and determining OPs in various water and juice samples.

5.3. From fruits, vegetables and water samples
Su.et al. introduced an effective methodology to extract of OPs from apple, cucumber and water samples [46]. They synthesized a new material based on dispersive solid phase extraction (DSPE): reduced graphene oxide coated with ZnO nanocomposites (RGO-ZnO). Although graphene is a very good sorbent, it can't be used directly as a sorbent because it involves numerous problems which can hinder the sorption behavior as well as the sorption capacity is affected. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the method showed a good linear response in the range of 0.5–200 ng/g with the R2 value ranging from 0.9894 to 0.9983. The LOD (S/N = 3) and LOQ for compounds ranged between 0.01 and 0.05 ng/g and 0.05–0.18 ng/g, respectively. The reliability of method with shorter extraction time, wider linearity, comparable reproducibility, and 75%–104.2% recovery range are the reasons for the proposed approach to be considered reasonable and confirmed as the faster, more sensitive, highly precise and effective method.

To extract OPs from some another fruits and vegetables, including green grapes, apple, celery pear, and from the river water, another experiment was performed by Mahpishanian et al., in 2015 [86]. They synthesized a new magnetic core-shell structured adsorbent Fe3O4@SiO2@GO-PEA. This synthesis took three main steps: the synthesis of Fe3O4@SiO2–NH2, Fe3O4@SiO2@GO and Fe3O4@SiO2@GO-PEA. The researchers concluded that the core-shell structured Fe3O4@SiO2@GO-PEA microparticle is a superior adsorbent because it has super paramagnetic properties and large saturation magnetization. It also has the highest extraction recovery as compared to other adsorbents. Many of the factors, such as the effect of desorption and extraction conditions, effect of pH, adsorbent dosage, salt concentration, reusability and reproducibility, influence the adsorption characteristics of the adsorbent toward the analytes. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the method exhibited a broad range of 0.06–200 μg L−1, with high R2 ranging from 0.9945 to 0.9996. The LOD ranged from 0.02 to 0.1 μg L−1, and the inter-day intra-day RSDs were below 6% and 5%, respectively. The recoveries obtained for fruits and vegetables ranged from 90.4% to 108.0% (with RSDs of 1.9%–6.6%, n = 3), while water samples exhibited recoveries between 94.6% and 104.2% (with RSDs of 2.0%–4.8%, n = 3). The outstanding ability of the adsorbent to extract effectively can be credited to its unique structural features, where the phenyl rings of 2-phenylethyl amine (PEA) grafted-GO nanosheets effectively interact with OPs via a delocalized π-electrons.

5.4. From fruit juice and vegetable samples
Pesticides are used to reduce or kill pests, but owing to their toxic effects, various methods are developed for their removal from particular samples. The MRL for OPPs residue in many vegetables and fruits lies in range of 0.01–0.3 mg kg−1 to 0.01 mg kg−1, set by EU Commission [50]. However, Iranian National Standard Organization (INSO) set an MRL range for OPs in tropical and subtropical fruits, between 0.05 and 7 mg kg−1 and for fruit-vegetables, between 0.05 and 1 mg kg−1 [87].

In 2016, Ma et al. prepared a magnetic 3D-G-Fe3O4 composite as an adsorbent for the extraction of OPs in fruit juices [50]. It was synthesized by the self-assembly of reduced GO nanosheets with Fe3O4 NPs. The resultant adsorbent 3D-G-Fe3O4 hydrogel was filtered and washed with water. However, the gel was also freezed (at constant temperature) to get the complete solidification and finally the black magnetic 3D-G-aerogel. The findings demonstrated a broad linear concentration range, with determination coefficients ranging from 0.9973 to 0.9999. The method exhibited detection limit (S/N = 3) ranging from 1.2 to 5.1 ng L−1, and LOQ (S/N = 10) ranging from 3.4 to 17.0 ng L−1. In terms of precision, the intra-day and inter-day relative standard deviations (RSDs) were 2.6–5.1% and 3.5–6.9%, respectively. The method was effectively utilized for analyzing OPPs in various fruit juices such as apple, orange, grape, sour-cherry, and apricot, with recovery rates ranging from 86.6% to 107.5%. Thus, this composite proves as a superior MSPE adsorbent to extract OPs from several fruit juice samples.

In 2017, Ayazi et al. introduced a methodology based on stir bar sorptive extraction of OPs from fruit juice and some vegetable samples [87]. They designed a novel nanocomposite in which GO was coupled with polyamide instead of graphene because it was concluded that the former could lead to superior extraction capability. The method demonstrated a LOD ranging from 0.3 to 1 ng mL−1, while the linear dynamic ranges spanned from 1 to 1000 ng mL−1 and 3–1000 ng mL−1. The accuracy of the method, as indicated by RSD%, was found to be between 6.2% and 9.1% for distilled water with a concentration of 100 ng mL−1. This method was effectively applied to analyze various vegetable and fruit juice samples, with 82.0%–95.6% recoveries.

Gong et al. fabricated a delicate enzymeless OP sensor with the help of a modified glassy-carbon electrode on graphene nanosheets decorated with Au NPs followed by SPE [88]. This nanostructured film helps in the adsorption of Nitroaromatic OPs on its surface by using Methyl Parathion (MP). Electrochemical methods such as cyclic voltammetric and square-wave voltammetric analyses were employed for the stripping voltammetric analysis of the captured MP. They conducted recovery tests by introducing varying quantities of MP into real samples of garlic, cabbage, and tea. The LOD for the sensor was found out to be 0.6 ng/mL for the OPs. Overall, this method proves to be fast, easy, stable, reproducible and highly accurate.

5.5. From cow milk samples
The contamination of OPPs in cow's milk is a major risk to public health. The transfer of OPPs to cow's milk can occur due to veterinary treatment against ectoparasites in insects. This transfer can also happen through inhalation, ingestion, animal feed containing grass or corn silage, or the water supply. In 2016, Nadeh et al. reported the presence of OPP residues in several raw and commercial pasteurized milk samples from Italy, Mexico, and Spain. European Union (EU) commission has established the Maximum Residue Level (MRL) for OPPs in milk in the range of 0.01 mg kg−1 to 0.05 mg kg−1 [43].

For the extraction and determination of OPPs, a new adsorbent was successfully designed by Nadeh et al. by incorporating a GO compound, which was reduced with LiAlH4 and NaBH4 to get graphene, followed by heat and stirring. Then the pure graphene coupled with FeCl3.6H2O (0.5 g) and (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2.6H2O (0.1 g), also 5 mL ammonia solution, was added to the degassed mixture with stirring for 2 h. A dark product named Fe3O4-graphene (Fe3O4@G) was obtained by one-pot synthesis, which was functionalized with cyanopropyltriethoxysilane (CNPrTEOS) to produce the final product sorbent Fe3O4@G-CNPrTEOS. It served as a great MSPE adsorbent which can be used directly without any further sample preparation for the simultaneous extraction of polar as well as non-polar OPPs from fresh cow milk samples [43].

5.6. Miscellaneous samples
Zhang et al. fabricated stable AChE biosensor using chitosan (CS) modified graphene nanofragments for the detection of OPPs [89]. It was further coated on the glassy-carbon electrode surface having layer-by-layer assembly. The LOD of the sensor is ∼55 pM, in the concentration range of 0.1–105 nM for the analyte. CS improves the mechanical flexibility of graphene nanostructures and hence improves the accuracy, and stability of the sensor.

Liu et al. developed a novel tyrosinase-based amperometric biosensor, immobilized on platinum NPs by using a graphene-modified glassy carbon electrode to detect various OPPs [90]. The detection limit for various OPPs such as chlorpyrifos, profenofos, and malathion came out to be 0.2, 0.8, and 3 ppb respectively. Overall, this biosensor is quite stable, efficient and shows good repeatability.

Overall, the researchers have provided distinct and various techniques to mitigate the excess concentration of OPPs by their removal from the affected samples. Unlike the other methods, the adsorption technique overweighs the advantages.

6. Removal of organochlorines
6.1. From water samples
Ponnusamy and Jen produced a simple and reliable GNS-coated stainless steel fibre for SPME [91]. FE-SEM and TEM images of microwave synthesized GNS and GNS-SPME fiber are shown in Fig. 5. They investigated the working performance of the GNS-coated fibre using microwave-assisted headspace SPME (MA-HSSPME) proceeded by GC-ECD to determine five OCPs in water samples. The effects of microwave irradiation power and duration, pH, ionic strength, and desorption conditions on extraction efficiency were carefully investigated. Under optimized circumstances, detection limits for the OCPs ranged from 0.16 to 0.93 ng L−1 and linear ranges from 1 to 1500 ng L−1, with R2 value ranging from 0.9984 to 0.9998, and RSDs ranging from 3.6 to 15.8% (n = 5). On comparing with commercially available SPME fibres, such as poly-dimethylsiloxane, the GNS fibre demonstrated higher efficiency of extraction and a healthier lifetime (>250 times), as well as improved reproducibility and better limits of detection. The comparison of extraction efficiency for OCPs using (a) MA–HS–GNS-SPME, and conventional hot bath HS-GNS-SPME; (b) MA–HS–GNS-SPME and MA–HS–PDMS-SPME. Other benefits include decreased manufacturing costs, ease of preparation, and a quicker extraction time. Hence, the suggested methodology is quick, sensitive, economical, and eco-friendly, with recoveries ranging from 80.1 to 101.1% for river water samples. Based on the data obtained from the applicability test for OCPs determination in actual water samples, it shows a high potential to serve as a cost-efficient and helpful tool for extraction in analytical methodologies."
,,"Shrivas et al. demonstrated a low-cost technology for stereoselective pesticides, endrin and dieldrin, from ambient water samples using a nanocomposite of GO depending on the pH, contact duration, and NPs dose quantity [92]. When the dose of GO-MNPs used was 30 mg for half an hour contact period with pH value 4.0 at room temperature, it was discovered that the elimination efficiency of both pesticides was improved. The R2 value with endrin and dieldrin were 0.975 and 0.973 respectively, indicating that the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model suited the data well. Endrin was determined to have a greater removal percentage (86.0%) and a higher slope value for the Langmuir adsorption isotherm than dieldrin (74.0%). The endo-position of the oxygen atom in the endrin molecule supports a greater adsorption percentage. Using Langmuir adsorption isotherm investigation, it was revealed that the adsorption of both pesticides on the surface of GOMNPs differed owing to the endo- and exo-position of oxygen atoms in the pesticide structure. Endrin exhibited a pseudo-first-order kinetic model, but dieldrin exhibited a pseudo-second-order kinetic model, indicating that the adsorption behaviour of both pesticides on the surface of GO-MNPs differed due to their endo- and exo-positions, respectively. Hence, the proposed method involves the utilization of low-cost GO-MNPs to remove pesticides from solution samples.

Luo et al. prepared a uniform, porous, and wrinkled substrateless graphene fibre using the hydrothermal method employed as an SPME sorbent [93]. The graphene fibre may be utilized to identify five OCs in ambient water samples under optimized conditions using the HS-SPME technique followed by GC/ECD. HS-SPME-GC/ECD technique demonstrated low detection limits (0.83–11.5 ng/L), broad linear dynamic ranges, and satisfactory repeatability (RSD <10.9%). In conclusion, graphene fibres may offer a potential alternative to existing SPME fibres yielding high recoveries (81–121%) and acceptable precisions (RSD 9%). The variation of extraction efficiencies with different parameters are discussed in Fig. 6."

Wang and coworkers reported an environmentally friendly method for producing a 3D-interconnected graphene framework with hierarchical pores [94]. While producing SPME fibre using the sol-gel process, hierarchical pores graphene framework (HPGF) materials outperformed the GO fibre and commercial PA fibre in terms of extraction performance for the five OCs. Under ideal conditions, the fibre demonstrated low detection limits (0.08–0.80 ng L−1), a broad linearity range of 10–30000 ng L−1 with the repeatability of 5 times for single fibre was between 5.1 and 11%, whereas reproducibility of 3 times for fiber-to-fiber ranged between 6.2% and 14%. Hence, the sensitivity and acceptable recoveries indicated that the proposed method might be employed as a simple, effective extraction and preconcentration procedure for tracing OCs in the water sample. Furthermore, the fibre was effectively used to analyze OCs in Pearl River water.

Mehdinia and coworkers used electrochemical polymerization to create a G/PANI SPME fibre, demonstrating high pesticide sensitivity and extraction efficiency [95]. The fibre can be used for SPME of OCs using the unique features of polyaniline and graphene. The modified fibre is thermally stable up to 320 °C and may be reused over 70 times. Because to graphene's high specific surface, it has a high extraction efficiency. The pesticides heptachlor, aldrin, endrin, and p, p'-DDT were extracted, and GC determined in aqueous samples using Pt fibre. Extraction duration, temperature, stirring rate, salinity, and headspace volume were all tuned. The approaches adopted demonstrated high accuracy, a reasonably large linear range with an R2 of 0.990, low detection limits (below 11 ng L−1 (at an S/N of 3)), and high recoveries varied from 81% to 112%. The novel fibre offers a viable alternative to commercial fibres for detecting OCs in contaminated seawater samples, with low RSDs and LODs, wide linear ranges, and acceptable recoveries.

In a study, Ke and coworkers reported the SPME of seven OCs using a graphene-coated SPME fiber [96]. It was synthesized using the sol-gel process by immobilizing Graphene onto a stainless wire of steel. The extraction efficiencies for the reported OCs were greater than the conventional 85 μm PDMS and 65 μm PDMS/DVB under optimal circumstances. Using the GC-MS analysis, the detection was found to vary from 0.19 ngL−1 for o, p-DDT to 18.3 ngL−1 for heptachlor using a sol-gel-graphene SPME fibre. The RSDs varied from 4.7% to 10.6% and the repeatability of each individual fibre were assessed. The reproducibility lied in between 2 and 14%. There was evidence of hexachlorobenzene (62.7 ng/L), trans-chlordane (79.6 ng/L), and p, p-DDT (9.30 ng/L) detection in rainfall, with the relative recoveries varied from 77.7% to 120%.

A study involved rGO magnetic NPs (Fe3O4/rGO-MNP) for the preconcentration of two OCs along with OPP from water and infant food samples using GC analysis [97]. The LOD was between 0.5 and 2.5 μg/L, resulting in hundred times increase in detection power when compared directly to the instrument's detection limits prior to preconcentration. The approach was used on seven ambient water samples and one infant food product, but no analytes were found.

6.2. From fruit and vegetable samples
The detection of OC residues in food samples is critical for environmental protection and public health. The analytical techniques used for the determination of OCs in vegetation and other food matrices are GC with particular detectors such as MS and electron capture detection (ECD) due to their high sensitivity. Before instrumental analysis, OCs in samples are extracted and enriched. MSPE is a novel SPE method based on sorbents with paramagnetic properties, has recently been widely employed for diverse materials. The major benefit of MSPE is the high extraction efficiency due to the increased active contact area between analytes and adsorbent, along with minimal extraction time and blockage difficulties.

A group of researchers reported the extraction of OCs from orange juice samples using a graphene-based magnetic nanocomposite (Fe3O4@G) [98]. In this study, covalent bonding was used to create graphene-coated Fe3O4 NPs. They demonstrated the utility of Fe3O4@G as an MSPE sorbent for extracting OCs from orange juice samples prior to GC-MS analysis. All analytes showed high linearity in the range of 1.0–200.0 ng mL−1, with R2 ranging from 0.9904 to 0.9992 under optimized experimental circumstances. The method's detection limits (S/N = 3) for the substances ranged from 0.01 to 0.05 ng mL−1. With RSDs below 9.6%, good reproducibilities were attained. On examining several experimental parameters such as pH, extraction time, the amount of Fe3O4@G, and adsorption conditions, the findings showed that the technique was simple and efficient for identifying OCs in juice with excellent sensitivity and repeatability. Therefore, Fe3O4@G has a lot of promise as an efficient absorbent for enriching the OCs in fruit juice due to its high absorption capacity, feasible magnetic separation, and the more complicated sample matrices.

Sun et al. reported that rGO coated with ZnO nanocomposites was effectively utilized to extract OCs from apple juice using DSPE and GC-MS analysis [99]. Similar to the previous study, the experimental factors that impact extraction efficiency were investigated and enhanced. All analytes had acceptable linearity in the range of 1.0–200.0 ng mL−1 under the ideal experimental circumstances, with R2 ranging from 0.9964 to 0.9994. The method's LOD for the substances was found between 0.01 and 0.05 ng mL−1. For intra-day and inter-day accuracy, good reproducibility was attained with RSDs <8.7%. The approach had recoveries between 78.1 and 105.8%, with RSDs ranging between 3 and 7%. Again, the results showed that the devised strategy was simple and efficient for enriching trace amounts of OCs in apple juice samples. The RGO-ZnO adsorbent had considerable application potential for the preconcentration of additional pesticides in complicated matrix materials.

A group of researchers analyzed the role of Graphene in effectively cleaning fruit and vegetable extracts in pesticide residue [100]. Due to graphene's extremely high surface area, it has been employed to preconcentrate, extract and selectively determine pesticide. Graphene was tested as an alternative cleaning sorbent for GC-MS detection of 17 pesticides in fruits and vegetables using the QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe) approach discovered by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN). Using 5 mg of graphene, the 17 pesticides recovered from the carrot, tomato, grape and rapeseed matrix ranging between 90 and 120%, with RSDs <10%. The outcomes showed that graphene is a novel, highly promising adsorbent.

6.3. From other samples
The authors used rGO-amino-HNT@PT to preconcentrate a few OCPs in herbal distillates using DSPE linked to GC-MS [101]. Halloysite nanotubes were combined with rGO, followed by loading polythiophene to create a hybrid nanocomposite. Its effectiveness for extracting substances was examined using 5 mg of nanocomposite, considering solvent, extraction duration, sorbent quantity, pH, salt concentration, and matrix effects. Under optimal conditions, the LOD (S/N = 3) for the six OCs are in the range of 2 and 13 ng L−1, with linearity extending from 0.1 to 100 g L−1. The RSD ranges from 6 to 10% for intra-day and inter-day with repeatability of 5 times. The recoveries were observed for all samples from pointed herbal distillate range.

Some researchers used beta-cyclodextrin/iron oxide rGO hybrid nanostructure (β-CD/MRGO) as an adsorbent in the vortex-assisted MSPE of 16 OCs from honey samples prior to GC-ECD analysis [102]. This study used a simple one-step green technique to prepare the magnetic nanocomposite with more water dispersibility, exceptional magnetic responses and selectivity. Under ideal conditions, OCs had a fair degree of linearity (2–10, 000 ng kg−1), with acceptable R2 value with >0.9966 and suitable RSD with <8%. Based on the signal-to-noise ratios of 3 and 10, the method's LOD and quantification limit were found to be in the range of 0.5–3.2 ngkg−1 and 1.7–10.7 ng kg−1 respectively. The MSPE technique was effectively used to analyze OCs in honey samples, with recoveries ranging from 78.8% to 116.2% and RSDs (n = 3) less than 8.1%. The findings suggest that the vortex-assisted MSPE based on -CD/MRGO hybrid composite can be useful for extracting and preconcentrating the ultra-trace levels of OCs residues in honey samples. Therefore, the CD/MRGO hybrid nanomaterial may have intriguing application potential as a biocompatible and nontoxic green sorbent for separating various organic pollutants during environmental pollution pre-treatments.

Luo at el. used mGraphene as a QuEChERS sorbent to determine OCPs in tobacco [103]. A technique for determining the presence of 26 OCPs residues in tobacco was developed under. The suggested method's detection limits for all the OCs residues ranging from 0.013 to 3.150 ng/g. The anticipated technique also demonstrated high linearity, with R2 more than 0.9985 for all target analytes. The procedure was shown to be reproducible since, for the inter- and intra-day precisions, the RSDs were less than 11.1 and 15.0%, respectively. Compared to previously published techniques for determining OCPs residues in tobacco, the suggested approach is simple to use, inexpensive in cost, and with a high clean-up ability. The approach can be applied effectively to analyzing OCPs residues in real-world samples.

Sajid and coworkers investigated the ability of double hydroxide/G hybrid as adsorbent for analytical preconcentration and extraction of 15 OCPs in urine samples [104]. The synthesized hybrid was subsequently used to extract OCPs from urine samples using membrane-protected stir-bar supported micro-SPE. This extraction method is ideal for materials with high complexity as the sorbent is adequately preserved inside the membrane. The method's performance variables were appropriately tuned, and the extracted materials were examined using GC-MS. With coefficients of determination up to 0.9996, this approach displayed good linearity. The detection limits varied from 0.22 to 1.38 ng mL−1. The RSD values for intra and inter-day precision were within acceptable limits of 2.7–8.3 % and 3.9–9.5 %, respectively. SB-μ-SPE based on LDH-G showed excellent analytical properties for extracting OCPs from urine samples.

7. Removal of carbamates
Carbamates are comprised of the carbamic acid ester with different substituents. These are commonly employed as pesticides in agricultural production as less-toxic alternatives to OP and OC classes [105]. Although carbamates can disintegrate to some extent, their excessive use has persistently lingered in fruits, vegetables, and harvests.

The European Union Directive on drinking water quality established a maximum allowed concentration of 0.1 μg L−1 for each pesticide and 0.5 μg L−1 for total pesticides [106]. As a result, monitoring the levels of carbamate residues in diverse environmental water systems are critical for human health and environmental safety. They may also infiltrate ecological water bodies through a variety of routes, including spraying, soil seepage, storage, and wastewater discharge, etc., thereby potentially contaminating the water [107]. As AChE inhibitors, these insecticides can impair neurological transmission, generating significant toxic effects in humans.

7.1. From water samples
Wu et al., in 2011 researched how for the first time, a graphene-based magnetic nanocomposite was synthesized through chemical precipitation and deployed as an effective adsorbent for preconcentrating certain carbamate pesticides in environmental water samples prior to HPLC analysis [108]. MSPE offers several advantages, such as easy separation of the adsorbent from the sample solution, high extraction capacity, good repeatability and high enrichment factors. Within the optimal conditions, the method exhibited enrichment factors for the substances ranging from 474 to 868. The method demonstrated a linear response across concentrations spanning from 0.1 to 50 ng mL−1. The LOD of the method for the pesticides were 0.02–0.04 ng mL−1. This method is faster than the conventional SPE method. The synthesized G-Fe3O4 composite demonstrates excellent adsorption capacity, superparamagnetic properties, strong magnetism and can be reused up to 12 times without significant loss of sorption capacity and magnetism. Therefore, graphene-based magnetic nanocomposite may have a broad array of applications for the preconcentration of other trace organic pollutants in various samples.

Shi et al., in 2014, adopted a graphene-based adsorption approach wherein for the first time, graphene-based adsorbent was used to determine a few persisting carbamate insecticides in environmental water samples [109]. Due to its high surface area and great adsorption capabilities, graphene was established to be an effective adsorbent for SPE enrichment and purification of carbamate insecticides. At the same time, the graphene-packed SPE cartridge was found to be highly reusable. For the investigation of these carbamate insecticides, graphene-based adsorbent provided satisfactory linearity with R2 around 0.9995. The carbamate pesticides were recovered well in lake, river and well water with an optimal recovery range from 81.1% to 111.0%. The LOD for these pesticides came in the range of 0.5–6.9 ng L−1. RSD values for were found in the range of 1.3–8.1% for n = 7. Based on the results, it is demonstrated that the anticipated method may be utilized effectively for the determination of traces of carbamates in a variety of water samples.

7.2. From fruit and vegetable samples
Ma and coworkers adopted graphene-reinforced microextraction in conjunction with HPLC–diode array detection to detect carbamate residues in fruit samples [110]. The key elements influencing carbamate extraction efficiency were examined and under optimal conditions; satisfactory linear nature was obtained in the range of 1–100 ng g−1 for carbaryl and 3–100 ng g−1 for the other analytes, with R2 of 0.9965–0.9993. The LODs for this method were <1.0 ng g−1. The method's recoveries ranged from 89% to 107% and RSDs fell between 6% and 8%. The results showed that the devised approach for determining carbamate pesticides in fruit samples is sensitive and efficiently methodical.

In 2015, Li et al. successfully demonstrated the determination of carbamate pesticides in tomatoes using Magnetic graphene SPE coupled with HPLC [111]. They synthesized novel graphene-based magnetic NPs (G-MNPs) using an unpretentious one-step synthesis method. These were developed as magnetic SPE adsorbents to determine carbamate traces in tomatoes. For the actual samples, high upgrading factors, reasonable linearities, relatively low LOD, and acceptable recoveries were reported. The accuracy of the method was substantiated by spiked recovery test where three sets of analytes were studied. Under the normal circumstances, the method yielded high enhancement factors, and demonstrated satisfactory linear relationships. The method also achieved low LOD ranging from 0.5 to 2.1 ng g−1 and reasonable spiked recoveries ranging from 90 to 102 %, with RSDs ranging from 1.2 to 5.9 %. The as prepared G-MNPs outperformed reduced graphene oxide in terms of carbamate pesticide extraction efficiency. The research revealed that the devised approach can be implemented as a simple yet effective extraction method to detect carbamate traces in tomato samples.

Gao et al., in 2019 undertook research wherein a GO-based composite (DABP-GO) was synthesized by amination using diazonium salt of 4, 4′-diaminobiphenyl (DABP) [44]. The composite was verified to be an effective SPE adsorbent for carbamates. It was further deployed to detect pesticide residues from vegetable samples of benincasahispida and pakchoi. The optimum parameters resulted in a linear range of 1–40 ng g−1. The pesticide concentrations were lower than their respective detection limits. The detection and quantitation limits of the six carbamates were 0.3–0.5 ng g−1 and 0.9–1.5 ng g−1 for benincasahispida samples, correspondingly, and 0.5–1.0 ng g−1and 1.5–3.0 ng g−1for pakchoi samples. The precision of measurements (RSDs) within the same day ranged from 2 to 8 % for the analyte concentration of 40 ng g−1. The precision across different days ranged from 4 to 9 % for 5 repeatitions. The composite's reusability was assessed by using it multiple times for extractions. After 25 extractions, the recovery of carbamate extractions decreased by around 10%, which was considered fairly good. This indicates that the DABP-GO composite is an effective SPE adsorbent for extracting certain carbamates from vegetable samples.

Therefore, there is a pressing need for dependable, sensitive, and quick analytical techniques that can accurately detect trace amounts of carbamate pesticides.

8. Removal of pyrethroids
Pyrethroid pesticides are generally used in agriculture and pest control. While they have low toxicity to mammals, these pesticides are highly toxic to aquatic organisms. To ensure consumer safety, the European Union has set maximum residue limits for vegetables. Hence, there is a need for a reliable and convenient method to detect small amounts of pyrethroids in water samples.

8.1. From water samples
Using NaCl as a template, Ma et al. fabricated Magnetic CoFe2O4-embedded porous graphitic carbon nanocomposites for the magnetic SPE of pyrethroids in environmental water samples [112]. The extraction process coupled with HPLC with a diode array detector was used in order to detect the traces of various pyrethroids in real water samples. The extraction performance for pyrethroid was investigated based on the synthesis conditions. A spectrum of parameters affecting magnetic SPE parameters have been studied, such as pH, amount of material, type of eluent, adsorption time and reusability. With an RSD of 0.2–5.8%, good recovery was achieved (80–111%). This study revealed nanocomposites and analytes mostly interact hydrophobically and are attracted to each other by dipole–dipole attraction.

Yang et al. used a template-free method to synthesize a graphene aerogel monolith within the SPE cartridge, which was used to separate pyrethroids insecticides from water samples using GC-MS analysis [113]. A graphene aerogel contains graphene sheets, which, through interaction between stacking and hydrophobic interactions, extract the analytes from water samples. Several parameters were studied, including adsorption properties, elution solvents, elution volumes, loading volumes, and pH. The optimized conditions achieved low detection limits of 0.83–9.31 ng L−1 and acceptable RSDs of 3.8–11.7%. A satisfactory recovery rate of 76.2–106.0% was achieved to extract pyrethroids from real water samples. This study suggests that graphene-related materials can be utilized in the pretreatment of water.

8.2. From fruit and vegetable samples
Wu et al. demonstrated the pretreatment of 8 pyrethroid residue samples with graphene for the first time [114]. Cucumber extracts were more effectively loaded with pigments with graphene. All of the pyrethroids recovered from samples pretreated with graphene ranged from 75 to 116% with RSDs less than 10%. When graphene was used for spinach extract cleanup, the recovery was satisfactory as well. As a promising new adsorbent for pesticide residue analysis, graphene has substantial potential.

In order to determine the concentration of some pyrethroid pesticides in orange and lettuce samples by GC-MS, graphene-grafted ferroferric oxide microspheres were used by Hou et al. as the adsorbent [115]. An investigation was conducted to optimize the extraction by varying the amount of adsorbent, pH and the concentration of salt in the solution. A linear response was obtained for the analytes in the concentration range of 0.3–100.0 ng/g with coefficients of determination ranging from 0.9877 to 0.9925 under the optimized conditions. Among the pyrethroids, the LOD ranged between 0.01 and 0.02 ng/g. A repeatable method of 90.0–103.7% recovery of pyrethroid pesticides was found with RSDs of <10.6%. Therefore, silica-coated magnetic graphene (Fe3O4@SiO2-G) microspheres showed satisfactory pesticide extraction results from orange and lettuce samples.

8.3. From other samples
Madej et al. suggested an approach in monitoring permethrin levels in human urine collected from individuals wearing uniforms disinfected with this pesticide [116]. Several pyrethroids from urine sample were isolated using a non-magnetically modified graphene as an adsorbent. It was done using dispersive SPE followed by the HPLC/UV method. A number of samples were selected but no targets were detected. Each analyte was added to these two kinds of water samples to assess the method's accuracy and applicability. They studied several parameters, including suspension volume, desorbent volume, adsorption and desorption time which affect permethrin extraction efficacy. Other experimental conditions, such as the speed and time of centrifugation and evaporation temperature, were kept constant during the sample preparation process. Acetonitrile was used as the desorbent. The extraction recovery of permethrin was considered as the optimization criterion.

Song et al. synthesized deep eutectic solvent graphene (DES-G) with micro-functionalization. It was used to extract five pyrethroid insecticides in beebread using dispersive micro solid-phase extraction (DMSPE) [117]. In this study, a novel functional reagent, DES was employed to modify graphene. This modification process was found to be simple and non-toxic. The micro-functionalized graphene maintained its excellent adsorption capability while mitigating the primary defect that causes agglomeration. DES-G was used to adsorb target analytes, followed by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) equipped with diode arrays to desort them. This technique was validated under the specified circumstances, demonstrating a high level of accuracy in retaining times, with a precision ranging from 0.43 to 0.57%. The repeatability was also assessed, showing a variation in peak areas ranging from 0.04 to 2.41%. The recoveries obtained for the natural product samples ranged from 80.9% to 114.1%. The experimental findings indicate that the method was straightforward, fast, sensitive, efficient, and environmentally friendly. Furthermore, the functionalization process of graphene and the utilization of DES-G hold promise for further investigation."
,,"9. Critical analysis of challenges for future research
Although graphene-based materials demonstrate significant promise for pesticide remediation, several challenges must be addressed to improve their performance and long-term viability. One of the major challenges is to enhance the pesticide removal efficacy of these materials through optimized synthesis and functionalization. The addition of diverse functional groups such as amine, carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups to graphene and its derivatives could augment their adsorption capacity and selectivity towards pesticides. The development of novel materials based on graphene could lead to better adsorption capacity and reactivity toward pesticides. For instance, graphene-based nanocomposites incorporating metal and metal oxide NPs have improved effectiveness in removing pesticides. This is due to the combined effects of these NPs, such as high surface area and enhanced catalytic activity. Hence, while considering graphene-based materials for pesticide remediation, it's crucial to assess the feasibility of scaling up their production for large-scale applications and their commercial potential.

The current state-of-the-art in using graphene-based materials for the detection of pesticides has demonstrated impressive sensing capabilities. However, a critical analysis reveals that there is still room for improvement in terms of sensitivity, especially for trace-level detection. Future research should focus on optimizing the sensor design, surface functionalization, and signal amplification strategies to enhance the sensitivity and reliability of graphene-based pesticide sensors.

While it has demonstrated the feasibility of graphene-based sensors in laboratory settings, their integration into real-world applications remains a challenge. Practical considerations such as sample preparation, user-friendly interfaces, and portability are often overlooked. Future research should emphasize the development of graphene-based sensor platforms that are user-friendly, adaptable to diverse sample types, and suitable for on-site detection in food and water processing facilities.

Current research often focuses on the detection of individual pesticides, limiting the practical applicability for comprehensive monitoring. A critical analysis reveals a need for the development of graphene-based sensor arrays capable of detecting multiple pesticides simultaneously. Future research should explore strategies for creating sensor platforms with increased specificity for different pesticides, enabling comprehensive and multiplexed detection in complex sample matrices.

Although laboratory studies have shown favorable results, making these materials on a large scale is still challenging. Furthermore, it's essential to evaluate the long-term sustainability of using graphene-based materials for pesticide removal, including their potential toxicity towards non-target organisms and impact on soil and water quality. Additionally, the release of graphene-based materials into the environment during their application needs to be assessed.

The cost-effectiveness and scalability of graphene-based sensors are crucial for widespread adoption. While the state-of-the-art showcases the potential of graphene, critical analysis reveals that the production costs and scalability challenges hinder large-scale implementation. Successful commercialization requires seamless integration of graphene-based sensors into existing food and water safety workflows. Compatibility with common sample matrices, such as fruits, vegetables, and water, and easy integration with conventional analytical methods can streamline the adoption process. Collaboration with industry stakeholders can help tailor graphene-based solutions to meet specific sector needs. Future research should focus on cost-effective synthesis methods and scalable manufacturing processes to make graphene-based sensors economically viable for routine use in food and water safety monitoring.

Despite these challenges, graphene-based materials are promising candidates for environmental mitigation. The future prospects in this field involve optimizing and developing new graphene-based materials with improved properties using synthesis and functionalization, scaling up and commercializing production, and evaluating their environmental impact.

10. Conclusions and future perspectives
In the face of escalating industrialization and expanding human activities, the release of hazardous substances into landfills, industrial sites, and private properties presents a looming threat to both the environment and human health. This issue has garnered global attention, prompting the exploration of innovative technologies aimed at mitigating environmental contamination. Environmental remediation, encompassing the removal or treatment of pollutants from soil, water, and air, as well as the restoration of contaminated sites to their original or acceptable states, stands as a crucial and evolving process in addressing the pressing challenges posed by widespread environmental degradation. Pesticides represent a significant class of pollutants known for their enduring presence in the environment. Their potential to contaminate soil, water, air, and cropland raises significant scientific concerns.

However, researchers have also explored graphene-coated fibers and nanocomposites for the removal of OCs from different samples. These materials have demonstrated enhanced extraction efficiency, lower detection limits, and improved reproducibility in SPME techniques. Applications span from water samples to fruits, vegetables, and other matrices, showcasing the versatility of graphene-based solutions in environmental monitoring and food safety. The studies collectively emphasize the potential of these materials as sensitive, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly tools for the extraction and preconcentration of OCs in diverse sample types. Additionally, the application of graphene-based magnetic nanocomposites and adsorbents for the removal and detection of carbamate pesticides in water, fruit, and vegetable samples using effective SPE and microextraction techniques have been discussed. The developed techniques exhibited satisfactory linearities, low limits of detection, acceptable recovery rates, high extraction capacity, good repeatability, and reusability, showcasing the promising role of graphene-based materials in efficiently analyzing trace levels of carbamate pesticides in various sample matrices. The research emphasized the importance of reliable analytical methods to detect and quantify carbamates, given the potential health and environmental risks associated with these pesticide residues. This review also highlighted the use of graphene-based materials for the removal and detection of pyrethroid pesticides. Various graphene derivatives, including magnetic composites, aerogels, and deep eutectic solvent-functionalized graphene, were employed for sample pretreatment and extraction in water, fruit, vegetable, and urine samples. These studies demonstrated the versatility and efficiency of graphene-based materials in extracting pyrethroids, showcasing their hydrophobic interactions, high adsorption capacity, and reusability. The optimized methods exhibited low limits of detection, satisfactory recovery rates, and good precision. Thus, the review indicates the potential of graphene-related materials in developing reliable and convenient analytical techniques for detecting trace amounts of pesticides, ensuring both environmental safety and consumer health.

,,"Abstract
Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has been introduced to detect pesticides at low concentrations and in complex matrices to help developing countries monitor pesticides to keep their concentrations at safe levels in food and the environment. SERS is a surface-sensitive technique that enhances the Raman signal of molecules absorbed on metal nanostructure surfaces and provides vibrational information for sample identification and quantitation. In this work, we report the use of silver nanostars (AgNs) as SERS-active elements to detect four neonicotinoid pesticides (thiacloprid, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and nitenpyram). The SERS substrates were prepared with multiple depositions of the nanostars using a self-assembly approach to give a dense coverage of the AgNs on a glass surface, which ultimately increased the availability of the spikes needed for SERS activity. The SERS substrates developed in this work show very high sensitivity and excellent reproducibility. Our research opens an avenue for the development of portable, field-based pesticide sensors, which will be critical for the effective monitoring of these important but potentially dangerous chemicals.

1. Introduction
Neonicotinoid pesticides, such as clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, have been restricted in the European Union but remain in use worldwide in the agricultural sector to meet the demands of population growth, urbanisation and market integration. Other neonicotinoid types commonly used to control pests are thiacloprid, dinotefuran, acetamiprid and sulfoxaflor. The demand for neonicotinoid pesticides for crop protection represents almost one-third of the global insecticide market due to their high insecticidal efficiency [1]. To control pests and reduce disease pressure on crops, the use of these pesticides as seed coatings in flowering crops is a widespread practice that can reduce overspray and spray drift. However, the pesticides used to treat the seeds can potentially be absorbed and spread through the tissue and reach pollen and nectars [2]. Then, insect pollinators such as honeybees and wild bees are exposed to the pesticides and bring them to their colonies [3]. The European Union announced a ban on the use of these chemicals after assessment studies from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) showed the negative effects of neonicotinoids on insect pollinators, including multiple responses on learning, memory performance and the feeding activity of bee species [4].
Neonicotinoid pesticides have similar chemical structures to nicotine and permanently bind with high infinity to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the insect central nervous system [5]. The active substances are neurotoxic and can overstimulate and disrupt the learning and memory behaviour of insect pollinators, resulting in brain damage. These negative impacts on the insect pollinators means they do not interact with crops as expected, affecting the yield and quality of the agricultural products, nutrient content and shelf life. Consequently, the decreasing value of pollinators’ services to agricultural systems leads to big effects on ecosystems and the world economy. Human and environmental exposure to the pesticides through release into the air, diffusion into water and relocation from seed to root, plant and nectar can mean that the pesticides linger for decades in the food chain, animals, humans and the environment. The impact of neonicotinoid pesticides on human health was investigated by Zhang’s group who reported neonicotinoid pesticide residue can be absorbed by the human body through surface water [6]. This can lead to memory loss, finger tremors, headaches, coughs, general fatigue and abdominal pain, as reported by Taira et al., who studied the neonicotinoid exposure in urine samples [7]. Hence, neonicotinoids are compounds of great concern because the active ingredients are systemic, persistent and have high solubility. Therefore, consistent monitoring and rigorous testing of pesticide residue are critical in all countries, especially developing countries.
Effective methods to detect the presence of pesticide residue in food and drinking water has been introduced owing to the increasing public awareness and government concern regarding pesticides’ impact on food security and human health. Tremendous techniques have been established for pesticide monitoring, such as liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS), gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays and capillary electrophoresis. The Rawat group detected imidacloprid, clothianidin, acetamprid and thiamethoxam in vegetables with a limit of the detection (LOD) at 0.5 µg/mL using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fitted with a UV-Vis detector [8]. The detection of thiacloprid with an LOD as low as 0.003 ng/mL using a time-resolved fluorescent microsphereimmunochromatographic test strip was reported by the Xu group by using recombinant antibodies [9]. Capillary electrophoresis methods with tandem mass spectroscopy were studied by Carbonell-Rozas’ group for the detection of nine neonicotinoid pesticides with an LOD as low as 1.25 × 10−5 g/mL [10]. Generally, these techniques have high sensitivity and are established as a major tool for pesticide identification and qualification. But these analytical techniques are laborious and time consuming, costly, require sophisticated instruments and experienced staff. Many developing countries cannot afford the expensive instruments or do not own sufficient instruments for the monitoring of pesticide residue in food or the environment. In contrast, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) offers faster analysis time, simpler protocols, low-cost operations and a field-deployable methodology for the identification and qualification of pesticide contamination. Several handheld Raman instruments are available from companies, such as Agilent Technologies, Bruker, Metrohm and Thermo Scientific, for the detection of low concentrations of materials typically in forensic situations. The production of commercial SERS substrates as ultrasensitive detectors as a sensing platform was developed by Nanova Inc. (Columbia, MO, USA), Hamamatsu Photonics (Hamamatsu city, Japan) and Renishaw Diagnostics (Glasgow, UK). However, this work seeks to establish an ultrasensitive detector that will allow the cheap, efficient, reliable mass production of sensing platforms, which would find applications in the detection of a wide range of toxins and other harmful chemicals. The outcomes will be precursors to significant steps towards the production of commercial sensors, which would help developing countries monitor a variety of environmentally harmful chemical species.
The discovery of Raman signal enhancement has opened the door for the first monitoring of single molecules in bioanalytics [11] and pesticides using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) by simply adsorbing organophosphorus pesticides on a silver surface as a SERS-active substrate [12]. Many publications have shown that the SERS effect is a powerful tool for the identification and qualification of pesticide contamination on the basis of their unique vibrational characteristics [13,14,15]. SERS is a highly sensitive technique that enhances the Raman intensities of molecules more than after adsorption on plasmonic nanostructured surfaces [16,17]. Subsequently, SERS has been continuously used to identify pesticide contaminations in aqueous systems [18] and in seawater [19].
In previous work, we synthesized star-shaped silver nanostructures and fabricated SERS substrates to use SERS enhancement of the Raman signal to detect the neonicotinoid imidacloprid. We studied the best distribution of silver nanostars (AgNs) on glass surfaces by varying the number of layers of AgNs thin films. These SERS substrates are promising for use in the field because detection without complex sample preparation is critical for real-world use in analytical facilities or more importantly in the field. Critically, it is important that such a sensor is sensitive to many different pesticides. The residue of the four pesticides tested in this work has become a global issue as their residues have been found in a variety of food products and environmental samples. Many countries have detected the residue of these pesticides in soil [20], water [6] and food products [21]. In the current work, we studied the four neonicotinoid pesticides on AgNs thin films. The pesticides were deposited on the AgNs surface by a drop-casting technique to observe the sensitivity and reproducibility of SERS substrates towards the neonicotinoid pesticides. This AgNs substrate was found to be a good SERS-active substrate for all the molecules, giving large SERS enhancements and excellent reproducibility with a low relative standard derivation of SERS intensity.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Materials
The four neonicotinoid pesticides used for the SERS measurements were imidacloprid-pestanal, (Analytical standard, Sigma-Aldrich (Sydney, Australia)), thiamethoxam-pestanal, (Analytical standard, Sigma-Aldrich (Sydney, Australia)), thiacloprid-pestanal (Analytical standard, Sigma-Aldrich (Sydney, Australia)) and nitenpyram-pestanal, (Analytical standard, Sigma-Aldrich (Sydney, Australia)). The solvent for preparing the pesticide solutions was methanol (Analytical Reagent Grade, Chem-Supply Pty Ltd (Adelaide, Australia)) and deionized water. The chemicals for the preparation of silver nanostars (AgNs) are silver nitrate (≥99.0%, Sigma Aldrich (Sydney, Australia)), sodium hydroxide (≥98.0%, Chem-Supply Pty Ltd (Adelaide, Australia)), hydroxylamine 50 wt. % in water (Sigma Aldrich, Sydney, Australia) and trisodium citrate dehydrate (≥99.0%, Sigma Aldrich (Sydney, Australia)). Toluene, (Analytical Reagent Grade, Chem-Supply Pty Ltd, (Adelaide, Australia)) and n,n-dimethylformamide (≥99.8%, Sigma Aldrich (Sydney, Australia)) were used for the fabrication of monolayer AgNs films. These chemicals were used as received without any further purification.
2.2. Methodology
The synthesis of the colloidal silver nanostars (AgNs) and the fabrication of the silver nanostars film were described in our previous article [22]. Colloidal AgNs was prepared by a chemical reduction technique by mixing 2.0 mL of 6.0 × 10−2 M hydroxylamine into 2.0 mL of 5 × 10−2 M sodium hydroxide. This mixture was stirred, and the solution colour changed to dark grey after adding 9.0 mL of 1 × 10−3 M silver nitrate and 0.1 mL of 1% w/v trisodium citrate dehydrate into the solution. The colloidal suspension was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 15 min. The pellet was collected and further used for the fabrication of SERS substrates. AgNs SERS substrates were prepared on glass surfaces using a self-assembly technique. The monolayer AgNs film was prepared by mixing 12.0 mL colloidal AgNs and 6.0 mL toluene to obtain the water–oil interface. The monolayer AgNs films were transferred onto the solid substrate by placing the silicon or glass substrate surface under the formed monolayer solution and the substrate was further dried at 60 °C for 1 h in an oven. This process was repeated multiple times to prepare 10 layers of AgNs films on the substrate surfaces.
Neonicotinoid pesticide solutions were prepared at 1 mg/mL concentration by dissolving 1 mg of the pesticides in 0.5 mL of methanol. The mixture was placed in an ultrasonic bath to dissolve the solid. After that, the pesticide solution was added to 0.5 mL of deionized water. This 1 mg/mL pesticide solution was used as the stock solution to prepare seven concentrations, namely 1 × 100, 1 × 10−1, 1 × 10−2, 1 × 10−3, 1 × 10−4, 1 × 10−5 and 1 × 10−6 mg/mL. These various concentrations were prepared by diluting 1 mg/mL of pesticide solutions with the appropriate amount of deionized water. For SERS measurements, the pesticide was dropped and dried on the AgNs surface and bare-glass surface.
The SERS measurements were performed using a Renishaw model InVia micro Raman spectrometer with 785 nm wavelength diode laser. The Raman spectra of the pesticide powders on glass slides were recorded using a 50× objective at 100% of the 167 mW power laser with 5-second integration time for reference spectra. The SERS spectra of the pesticides on the silver nanostars surface were collected using a 50x objective at 1% of the 167 mW power laser with 5-second integration time. SERS sensor properties such as sensitivity and reproducibility towards the pesticide detection were observed in this work. The reusability and stability of the SERS substrate were reported in a previous article [22].
2.3. Computional Model
Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression was used to perform multivariate analysis on spectroscopic data. Python codes using the libraries numpy, scikit-learn and scipy were used for SG filtering and PLS regression. The SG filtering was implemented using the savgol_filter function from the scipy.signal module. PLS regression was carried out using the PLSRegression class from the sklearn.cross decomposition module while cross-validation predictions were made using the cross_val_predict function from sklearn.model selection.
A Savitzky–Golay filter was applied to smooth the spectra and calculate the first derivative of the spectra, which is used in the analysis. The optimal number of PLS components and the relevant wavelengths are determined by optimising the R2 and mean square error of cross-validated data. To improve the performance of the model, the values of the concentrations were transformed using the logarithm function, which helps to linearize the relationship between the predictor variables (spectra), and the response variable (concentration) reduces the effect of outliers and spreads the values out more evenly across the range of possible values. This improves the stabilization of the response variable and makes the model more sensitive to small changes at low concentrations. The regression graphs were plotted using Microsoft Excel 2010.
3. Results
In this report, we used a AgNs substrate prepared through 10 subsequential layer depositions of silver nanostars (AgNs) on a glass surface as the SERS substrate, as described in our previous article [22]. To comprehensively study the SERS performance for various neonicotinoid pesticides on the SERS substrates, we collected the Raman spectra of neonicotinoid pesticide powders for the reference of neonicotinoid characteristic peaks. Figure 1A–D show the Raman spectra of four neonicotinoid pesticide powders, namely thiacloprid, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and nitenpyram. The characteristic Raman peaks for each pesticide were obvious. The chemical structures of these pesticides are attached in the SI, Figure S1.

The sensitivity of the SERS substrate was studied by observing the Raman spectrum of the pesticides on a glass surface and on the AgNs surface using the same solution concentration for the drop casting and same laser configuration but 100-times less power for the experiments on the SERS substrates. Figure 2A–D display the Raman spectra of the pesticides on the glass surface and on the AgNs surface at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. Based on the SERS spectra, the characteristic peaks of the pesticides on the AgNs surface match those observed for the pesticides on the glass surface. The observed characteristic peaks of the absorbed pesticides on silver nanostars are in good agreement with the observed characteristic peaks of pesticide powders. The details of the characteristic peaks for the pesticide powder, on glass surface and on AgNs, are discussed in the SI, Tables S1–S4. The intensity of the characteristic peaks of these pesticides at 1 mg/mL was clearly enhanced after the absorption of the pesticides on the silver surface compared to the low Raman intensity of the pesticides on bare glass surfaces at 1 mg/mL. To calculate the Enhancement Factor (EF) of SERS performance, some of the highest peaks at 2174 cm−1, 295 cm−1, 759 cm−1 and 1102 cm−1 were chosen for thiacloprid, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and nitenpyram, respectively. The calculated EFs for thiacloprid, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and nitenpyram detection were 3.61 × 105, 2.86 × 104, 9.53 × 104 and 2.40 × 105, respectively. There are a few EF formulae for EF calculations and, here, we chose the Analytical Enhancement Factor approach, as described by Ru et al.’s group [23]. These EF values were calculated using Formula (1)."
,,"SERS enhancement happens through two mechanisms, namely an electromagnetic (EM) mechanism and a chemical (CM) mechanism [16,24,25]. The EM mechanism is generally observed on substrates rich in free electrons that can generate localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) upon excitation [26]. The CM mechanism can have three possible origins in a metal–molecule system, namely interfacial ground-state charge transfer, photoinduced charge transfer resonance and the electronic excitation resonance within the molecule itself [27]. In our experiments, the laser wavelength is 1.58 eV, while the pesticides examined have energy gaps ranging from 2.084 to 7.94 eV; thus, resonance Raman of the molecule itself is not possible [28]. The Fermi level of silver nanoparticles is generally about −4.26 eV [29], meaning that in all cases, the energy of the LUMO is higher than the Fermi level of AgNs, while the energy level of the HOMO is below the Fermi level. As shown in Table 1, the gaps between the levels for each molecule and the Ag Fermi level vary dramatically but, in all cases, significant SERS enhancement is observed. The large gaps between the LUMOs and the Fermi level mean that a photoinduced charge transfer resonance mechanism is unlikely [29]. Thus, this means that the most likely SERS enhancement mechanism is a combination of electromagnetic enhancement due to surface plasmon excitation in the metal nanoparticles [30] and interfacial ground-state charge transfer. These ground state interactions change the polarizability of the metal–molecule complex, leading to higher Raman cross-sections. Importantly, despite a range of HOMO energy levels of over 2.5 eV, the SERS substrate gives high enhancements for all the pesticides, highlighting the wide applicability of this approach to detect many species of environmental concern."
,,"Abstract
Fluorinated pesticides acquired a significant market share in the agrochemical sector due to the surge of new fluoroorganic ingredients approved in the last two decades. This growing trend has not been accompanied by a comprehensive scientific and regulatory framework entailing all their potential negative impacts for the environment, especially when considering the hazardous properties that may result from the incorporation of fluorine into organic molecules. This review aims to address the safe/hazardous dichotomy associated with fluorinated pesticides by providing an updated outlook on their relevancy in the agrochemical sector and how it leads to their role as environmental pollutants. Specifically, the environmental fate and distribution of these pesticides in the ecosystems is discussed, while also analysing their potential to act as toxic substances for non-target organisms."
,,"1. Fluorine's emerging role in the agrochemical market
Halogenated heteroatoms have always played a relevant role in the crop protection industry, mostly through the dominance of organochlorine pesticides. Fluorinated pesticides (i.e., pesticides harbouring one or more fluorine atoms in their molecular structure), only recently acquired enough traction in this market to compete with organochlorine pesticides, and they are steadily becoming an established commodity in modern agriculture (Key et al., 1997).

By the end of the 20th century, the representation of fluoroorganic pesticides in the agrochemical market was subpar, accounting for only 9% of all pesticides commercialized worldwide (Key et al., 1997). Roughly two decades later, fluorinated pesticides substantially increased their representation, accounting for more than half of the pesticides approved between 2010 and 2020. Even more prominently, fluorinated pesticides accounted for almost 70% of the new agrochemicals approved during the second half of the last decade (Jeschke, 2017, 2021; Ogawa et al., 2020). In a timespan of roughly 30 years, fluorine-containing pesticides drastically expanded their market share and evolved into a major chemical class of pesticides. Two key drivers are likely responsible for this market expansion: (i) the development of novel regio- and enantioselective synthetic methods capable of embedding fluorine into organic scaffolds more efficiently and (ii) the expiration of patents and other intellectual property rights that prevented fluorinated agrochemicals of being distributed by competing manufacturers (Burriss et al., 2018; Fujiwara and O'Hagan, 2014).

Inevitably, many fluorinated pesticides are now frequently featured among the top-selling pesticides used for the treatment of the most economically relevant crops in the world, regardless of pesticide type or target crop (Table 1). Among these, the insecticides fipronil and λ-cyhalothrin, the fungicides epoxiconazole and trifloxystrobin and the herbicide clodinafop stand out as they have consistently ranked among the best-selling pesticides worldwide for almost 20 years (Maienfisch and Hall, 2004). Furthermore, their commercial appeal also considerably accelerated the introduction of new agrochemical formulae based on fluoroorganic molecules (Jeschke, 2021)"
,,"2. Fluorine substitution as a means of improving biocidal performances
The attractiveness of molecular fluorination in agrochemicals relies on its capacity to fine-tune their in vivo stability, lipophilicity and stereochemical behaviour. The modulation of these attributes leads to the emergence of many favourable properties that are sought on an ideal pesticide, such as high selectivity and specificity, quick action and prolonged residual activity, without neglecting the potency and spectrum of the intended biological activity (Hong, 2009).

Fluorination of organic molecules usually contributes to an improvement of molecular stability due to the optimal orbital compatibility between carbon (Cδ+) and fluorine (Fδ−) and to the extreme electronegativity of this latter element (Table 2). Both these properties are responsible for one of the most robust covalent bonds known in nature, characterized by its great high dissociation energy (up to 485 kJmol-1), short chemical bond (1.35 Å) and strong dipole moment (1.41 D) (Gillis et al., 2015; Kiel and Engesser, 2015; O'Hagan, 2008) (Table 2). Fluorine's electronegativity further extends molecular stability in two different ways: (i) by allowing this element to behave as an electron-withdrawing element when bound to carbon and to acquire a noble gas-like electron configuration when accepting an additional electron and (ii) by forcing atypical gauche-like conformations, which allow fluorine substituents to act as a shield to vicinal atoms and moieties, thus preventing nucleophilic and electrophilic attacks (Gillis et al., 2015; Thiehoff et al., 2017).

Table 2. Comparison of the physicochemical properties of the most common substituents in agrochemicals."
,,"Fluorine substitution can also exhibit a significant impact on pesticide potency and selectivity by influencing its lipophilic nature and stereochemical behaviour. Nevertheless, one should be aware that fluorination of aromatic and aliphatic molecules can prompt distinct physicochemical alterations (Linclau et al., 2016; O'Hagan and Young, 2016) and, thus, the positive influence of fluorine substitution in lipophilicity is not observable in all fluorinated pesticides, nor it always reflects a higher lipophilic profile comparatively to other halogenated pesticides. Still, fluorine substitution mostly occurs in aromatic scaffolds and for these aromatic fluoroorganics the increase in the lipophilicity is a direct result of the effect of fluorine's electronegativity on the pKa of aromatic and heteroaromatic functional groups (Linclau et al., 2016). In general, the occurrence of fluorinated arguments in ionizable aromatic moieties, as well as in their vicinity, results in a reduction of their basicity which will enhance lipophilicity and ultimately increase pesticide performance by promoting hydrophobic interactions, membrane permeability and protein binding (Gillis et al., 2015). These modulations also increase the distribution rate of fluorinated pesticides and, thus, reduce possible interactions with secondary targets. Additionally, the stereochemical similarity shared between fluorine and hydrogen allows fluorine substitution to occur with virtually unaltered molecular performances in terms of ligand efficiency, substrate recognition and overall biokinetics (Meanwell, 2018; Pettersson et al., 2016). Furthermore, depending on the biochemical context, fluorinated motifs can also act as effective bioisosteres of other chemical groups, such as carbonyl, sulfonyl, carbinol or nitrile functional groups, further expanding their minimalistic role as a heteroatom substituent besides hydrogen replacement (Meanwell, 2018).

2.1. Typical fluorination strategies and recent examples of improved pesticides
Fluorine substitution in agrochemicals is usually observed in aromatic scaffolds, though substitution of heterocyclic or aliphatic side groups can also be encountered (Hong, 2009). Fluorination is traditionally achieved by the incorporation of trifluoromethyl (CF3), difluoromethyl (CHF2) or difluoromethoxy (CHF2O) moieties, with fluorine arising either as the sole halogenated heteroatom or as part of a polyhalogenation strategy (Fujiwara and O'Hagan, 2014). Less commonly explored are fluorination strategies involving the addition of heptafluoroisopropyl [(CF3)2FC] groups, which can be found more commonly in pesticides launched in the last decade, such as pyrifluquinazon (launched in 2010) or broflanilide (launched in 2014) (El Qacemi et al., 2019). More recently, fluorination strategies involving the incorporation of complex fluorinated moieties such as 2,2-difluoroethyl (CHF2–CH2), difluoromethyl-sulfonyl (CHF2–SO2) and 1-methoxy-heptafluoro-isopropyl [(CF3)2–CH3OC] have also emerged (Sparks and Lorsbach, 2017).

Table 3 lists fluorinated pesticides launched between 2015 and 2020 that showcase many of the abovementioned fluorination strategies. These pesticides either derive from traditional development pipelines, mostly resulting from the fine-tuning of known active ingredients, or correspond to novel agrochemicals that were developed using toxic natural products as lead compounds. Fluorination of already existing pesticide ingredients is usually sought by manufacturers to attempt to mitigate their environmental impact or to circumvent scenarios of pesticide resistance. This approach represents a hallmark strategy for the development of fluorinated pesticides and even nowadays it keeps yielding commercially viable products, as is the case of the recently launched fluorinated pesticides pyflubumide or triflumezopyrim (Table 3) (Holyoke et al., 2015; Nakano et al., 2015). For example, Martins et al. (2020) suggested that the replacement of chlorine by fluorine in the banned insecticide chlordane (logP of 5.96) could be a viable strategy to produce derivatives with similar efficiency, but with lower potential for bioaccumulation and bioconcentration in comparison (logP of 2.96), which were the main causes for the worldwide ban of chlordane. Similarly, by altering the position and degree of fluorination of flupyradifurone (logP of 1.84), Mesquita et al. (2020) were able to achieve a series of trifluoroacetyl and trifluoromethyl substituted derivatives with improved insecticidal activities due to their enhanced lipophilicities (logP of 3.65–4.53) and metabolic stabilities. Furthermore, a suite of fluorinated analogues of diamide insecticides was recently proposed in an effort to bypass the growing resistance observed towards this group of pesticides (Li et al., 2020; Richardson et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a; Zhao et al., 2020b; Zhao et al., 2020c; Zhou et al., 2018). In general, most of the proposed fluorinated diamide analogues performed similarly or better than the non-fluorinated analogue chlorantraniliprole, with trifluoroethoxyl substitution showing to be the most promising synthetic strategy (Zhao et al., 2020c; Zhou et al., 2018).

Table 3. Main fluorinated pesticides launched between 2015 and 2020. Unless otherwise stated, typical half-life values (DT50) and octanol-water partition coefficients (logP) were obtained from the Pesticide Properties Database (Lewis et al., 2016). LogP values indicated with (*) correspond to theoretical values retrieved from the PubChem® Database (Kim et al., 2020). N/A refers to unavailable LogP and/or DT50 values for some of the listed pesticides, due to their recent market introduction.
"
,,"On the other hand, modification of natural scaffolds with fluorinated arguments can pose as an ingenious strategy to develop efficient pesticides, given the biomimetic potential of fluorine substitution. This approach is rapidly becoming a relevant development avenue, given the amount of new fluorinated pesticides that have recently emerged following this strategy (Table 3). Some examples include (i) flupyradifurone, which is the end result of successive chemical iterations stemming from the natural product stemofoline (Jeschke et al., 2015; Nauen et al., 2015); (ii) halauxifen-methyl, which emerged as an alternative to the highly persistent 6-arylpicolinate herbicides whose lead structures were microbial metabolites (Epp et al., 2018); (iii) florylpicoxamid, which was inspired by a fermentative secondary metabolite produced by a Streptomyces bacterium (Babij et al., 2020); and (iv) quinofumelin, a fluorinated fungicide that incorporates the quinoline skeleton commonly found in the naturally-occurring quinolines alkaloids (Wang et al., 2021). More recently, several other natural products have been explored as potential lead structures for novel fluorinated pesticides. For instance, Park et al. (2020) synthesized a series of fluorinated analogues of benzyl acetone essential oils and found that single fluorination at the para-position resulted in an improved insecticidal efficiency. The authors also concluded that although fluorination led to improved efficiencies, the site of fluorine substitution was more important than the increase in the degree of fluorination (Park et al., 2020). Similarly, a series of fluorinated analogues of the natural products galegine and nortopsentin, either harbouring a single fluorine atom or a trifluoromethyl substituent (logP of 2.90–3.50), yielded better in vitro activities than the commercial non-fluorinated insecticides imidacloprid (logP of 0.57), carbendazim (logP of 1.48) and chlorothalonil (logP of 2.94) that were used as controls (Lewis et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2020a; Zhao et al., 2020a).

3. Fluorinated pesticides as environmental pollutants
In general, as a result of fluorine substitution, fluoroorganics exhibit distinct patterns of environmental distribution, bioaccumulation and ecotoxicity, especially when compared with their organohalogenated cohorts (Savoca and Pace, 2021). For fluorinated pesticides, their role as environmental pollutants is heavily influenced by the same properties that turn them into quasi-ideal biocides, namely their fluorine-induced molecular stability and lipophilic modulation, as well as their capacity to pose as bioisosteres. Indeed, the positive influence that fluorine substitution can have on pesticides biocidal activity may also translate into a magnification of their environmental impact, as these attributes may lead to the emergence of highly stable molecules with a low reactive profile and with a large potential to inflict ecosystem damage, due to their recognized persistence, bioaccumulation potential and ecotoxicological effects (Kiel and Engesser, 2015; Moreira et al., 2018; Tong et al., 2019). Still, studies disclosing the contribution of fluorine substitution to the ecotoxicology of fluorinated pesticides, namely by comparing their toxic profiles with those of non-fluorinated pesticide analogues, are still scarce.

3.1. Influence of fluorination on environmental fate and dynamics
Being highly stable molecules, fluorinated pesticides are not readily biodegradable in the environment. Even though the agrochemical industry is pushing towards the development and use of less persistent pesticides, it is still common to find approved fluorinated pesticides classifying as persistent pollutants according to regulatory guidelines. For example, in regulatory risk assessments elaborated within European Union jurisdiction, a pesticide is considered persistent if its half-life period (DT50) equals or exceeds 30 days. Applying this persistence metric either to the top-selling fluorinated pesticides (Table 1) or to those approved in the past five years (Table 3) results in the majority of these active ingredients classifying as persistent (30 days < DT50 < 365 days) or very persistent (DT50 > 365 days) (Lewis et al., 2016). Surprisingly, some of the pesticides launched since 2010 also correspond to the most persistent pesticides among the listed compounds, such as pydiflumetofen (DT50 of 2416 days), bixafen (DT50 of 500 days), flubendiamide (DT50 of 500 days), isoflucypram (DT50 of 318.5 days), mefentrifluconazole (DT50 of 268 days) or fluxapyroxad (DT50 of 183 days) (Table 1, Table 3) (Lewis et al., 2016).

Besides their typical persistence, the environmental dynamics of fluorinated pesticides are also markedly influenced by their usually high lipophilicities. Lipophilic modulation grants these pesticides a higher affinity to bioaccumulate in living organisms, as several studies have shown. For instance, Martinello et al. (2020) found a correlation between the bioaccumulation of fluorinated pesticides in honeybees, alongside other types of pesticides, and events of mass mortality of colonies of these insects in Italy. The authors have found a wide array of different fluorinated pesticides bioaccumulated in dead honeybees, including fludioxonil, fluopicolide, fluopyram, flutriafol, tefluthrinm, trifloxystrobin and fipronil, in amounts as high as 140 ng per bee (Martinello et al., 2020). Pyrethroids, including the fluorinated congeners λ-cyhalothrin, cyfluthrin, bifenthrin and fluvalinate, have also been widely implicated in bioaccumulation phenomena in aquatic (Alonso et al., 2012; Aznar-Alemany et al., 2017; Clasen et al., 2018; Corcellas et al., 2015; Rossi et al., 2020) and terrestrial organisms (Bro et al., 2016; Corcellas et al., 2017; dell'Oro et al., 2014; Millot et al., 2015; Souza et al., 2013), as well as in humans, including babies exposed through lactancy (Bouwman et al., 2006; Feo et al., 2012; Sereda et al., 2009). Similarly, the pesticides fluazinam and teflubenzuron were also reported to bioaccumulate in Brachydanio rerio fish and Pandalus montagui shrimp, respectively, reaching significantly high levels after relatively short acute or sub-chronic exposure periods (Olsvik et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2020b). Accordingly, several fluorinated pesticides are currently flagged as candidates for substitution in the European Union due to their bioaccumulation potential, including (but not restricted to) flufenacet (LogP = 3.5/Koc = 401), flumioxazin (LogP = 2.5/Koc = 889), epoxiconazole (LogP = 3.4/Koc = 2525) or λ-cyhalothrin (LogP = 5.5/Koc = 283,707) (Table 1) (Lewis et al., 2016).

Improved lipophilicity of fluorinated pesticides can also favour their sequestration by organic carbon in soils or other matrices rich in organic matter and clays, which can significantly influence their environmental dynamics. Firstly, compounds with higher affinity for organic carbon adsorption are less mobile, which may increase the probability of exposure of organisms inhabiting these habitats. This may trigger a series of ecotoxicological events that can lead to serious ecological impacts in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (Sarkar et al., 2020). Furthermore, increased sorption can also promote the persistent nature of these pesticides by impairing their biodegradability. As the adsorbed fluorinated pesticides become less bioavailable for environmental microorganisms, they may be less susceptible to biodegradation and subsist as their parental isoforms for longer periods of time (Sarkar et al., 2020). An illustrative example is broflanilide, a relatively new insecticide that exhibits a very high lipophilic profile due to its very high fluorination degree (11 fluorine heteroatoms in total). This pesticide showed intense affinity for adsorption in soils with high content of organic carbon (Xie et al., 2021), which may partially correlate with its high half-life period of 596 days in soils (Lewis et al., 2016). Similarly, other highly lipophilic fluorinated pesticides, such as epoxiconazole or flufenacet, have also displayed strong affinities for adsorption to organic matter in soils and, consequently, extended half-lives in these matrices (Bošković et al., 2020; Marín-Benito et al., 2020).

More recently, the pesticide-plastic nexus has emerged as a relevant interface also capable of influencing the global fate and dynamics of pesticides in the environment (Wanner, 2021). These interactions have revealed to be particularly important for fluorinated pesticides, as they tend to be more prone to plastic adsorption than their non-fluorinated counterparts due to their typically high lipophilicities. With the adsorption mechanisms being more intimately associated with lipophilicity, rather than with the type of plastic itself (Wanner, 2021), fluorinated pesticides become more liable to adsorb to plastic fragments of varying sizes, which may grant them a higher environmental mobility and contribute to their persistence. For instance, epoxiconazole showed to be one of the pesticides with higher adsorption capacity to polyethylene microplastics among the tested compounds, which also caused a significant prolongation of its half-life in the aquatic environment (Wang et al., 2020b). Plastic adsorption studies conducted by Tubić et al. (2021) reached a similar conclusion for trifluralin, in which this fluorinated herbicide showed high affinity for adsorption to polyethylene microplastics in aqueous media. Similar observations have also been made in agricultural soils, where microplastic pollution is particularly relevant due to the common use of plastic mulches in agriculture. For instance, flubendiamide was found to be the most adsorbed compound to polyester fibres and polypropylene particles among the tested pesticides, which also led to an increase of its mobility in the soil system (Šunta et al., 2020).

3.2. Influence of fluorination on ecotoxicity
The minimal stereochemical impacts arising from the substitution of physiologically relevant building blocks by fluorinated moieties may have implications on their potential non-target toxicity, especially in cases where fluorinated pesticides originate from natural products or exhibit some structural analogy to key biological substrates. For example, the herbicide fluroxypyr (auxin analogue) and the rodenticide fluoroacetate (acetate analogue) are accurate representations of pesticides whose modes of action rely on triggering analogue-type responses on their target organisms, which may broaden their ecotoxicological spectrum (Boutin et al., 2014; O'Halloran et al., 2005; Power et al., 2013). Additionally, the mode of action of many fluoroorganic pesticides revolves around mechanisms of enzymatic inhibition that exploit this type of substrate similarity, such as the aryloxyphenxyproprionate class of herbicides (e.g. clodinafop and cyhalofop-butyl), which act as acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitors (Whittingham, 2016) or pyrazole fungicides (e.g. bixafen and fluxapyroxad) that inhibit the activity of succinate dehydrogenases (Walter, 2012). Both these groups of pesticides target key enzymes that are present in most living organisms, thus expanding the range of sensible species they may negatively affect by impairing central physiological processes in these non-target organisms.

Besides endowing fluorinated pesticides with a broader ecotoxicological scope, their bioisosteric nature combined with other relevant properties modulated by fluorination, can turn these compounds into potent acute and chronic contaminants at sublethal or field-realistic concentrations (Table 4). Murphy et al. (2012) first called attention to this issue and highlighted the potential of various fluorinated pesticides, such as fipronil, trifluralin or epoxiconazole, to act as endocrine disrupting, genotoxic and immune suppressing agents after acute and chronic exposures of terrestrial and aquatic organisms. Since then, several new studies have corroborated these findings not only for these flagship pesticides, but also for a broader selection of fluorinated pesticides."
,,"Endocrine disruption linked to reproductive and teratologic toxicity is possibly the most reported toxicity endpoint linked to fluorinated pesticides, given the diversity of compounds that are implicated as endocrine antagonists and teratological agents. Epoxiconazole has been recognized as a powerful endocrine and developmental toxicant due to its capacity to inhibit the activity of monooxygenases involved in steroidogenesis in rats and human cell lines at different concentrations (Kjærstad et al., 2010; Taxvig et al., 2007) (Table 4). Lauschke et al. (2021) attributed these inhibitory effects to the high homology shared between the fungal target of epoxiconazole, sterol 14α-demethylase, and other eukaryotic monooxygenases that participate in the biosynthesis of steroid hormones, leading to a down-regulation of the whole steroid biosynthetic pathway in sensible organisms. This fungicide has also shown similar fetotoxic features in rats and zebrafish at different concentrations (Jia et al., 2019; Taxvig et al., 2007; Weng et al., 2021) (Table 4), which is believed to be one of the reasons why its approval status is currently being phased out in many European countries (Lewis et al., 2016). A study on the estrogenic activities of several pesticides also brought into light the potential disruptive effect of flutolanil on the endocrine system, attributed to its capacity to mimic oestrogen in human cell lines (Oh et al., 2007) (Table 4). More recently, Teng et al. (2020) confirmed this potential by showing evidence of gonad endocrine"
,,"disruption in zebrafish (Table 4). Similarly, fludioxonil was implicated as an endocrine disruptor in a high-throughput in vitro antiandrogen screening performed by Orton et al. (2011). Since then, several other authors have corroborated these findings by highlighting the capacity of this fungicide to cause developmental effects as an androgen antagonist (Teng et al., 2012) and induce oxidative stress, cellular apoptosis and other physiological processes in a range of concentrations (Wang et al., 2020d) (Table 4). While the mode of action of fludioxonil remains elusive to this day, it is hypothesized that its toxicity is centred upon the simultaneous disruption of electron transport in mitochondria and the quenching of antioxidant pathways in cells via catalase inhibition, leading to a cytosolic accumulation of reactive oxygen species (Brandhorst and Klein, 2019). Although less explored, several other fluorinated pesticides have also been implicated as triggers of endocrine disruption and reproductive toxicity in human and non-human targets, including λ-cyhalothrin (DeMicco et al., 2009; Orton et al., 2011), fipronil (Silva et al., 2020; Stehr et al., 2006), bifenthrin (DeMicco et al., 2009; Tu et al., 2016), trifluralin, oxyfluorfen, flusilazole, flubendazole and fluvalinate (Garcês et al., 2020) (Table 4).

Recently, evidence of acute and chronic immunotoxicity has also been reported for several fluorinated pesticides. Bifenthrin has shown to inhibit cytokine production and to target macrophages by impairing cellular viability and"
,,"inducing apoptosis (Wang et al., 2017). Similarly, the pesticides lufenuron and flonicamide also evidenced immunosuppression potential as a consequence of oxidative stress, given their capacity to impair the expression of antioxidant-related genes in common carp (Taheri Mirghaed et al., 2020). Sublethal concentrations (Table 4) of the fluorinated insecticide flupyradifurone also showed to significantly impair immune pathways in bees during their development stage, which also led to augmented susceptibility to other environmental stressors in later life stages (Al Naggar and Baer, 2019). Fipronil was also reported to induce immune suppression by causing oxidative stress and genotoxic effects on the thyroid of albino mice, either when exposed individually or in a mixture with the non-halogenated fungicide mancozeb (Bano and Mohanty, 2020). The authors postulate that pesticide exposure induced persistent syndromes of hypothyroidism in mice, ultimately interfering with lymphoid organ development and affecting immunological fitness (Bano and Mohanty, 2020). In fact, genotoxicity in different model organisms is a common toxicity endpoint attributed to fipronil, which translates not only into immunosuppression effects, but also into other physiological and behavioural alterations (Amaeze et al., 2020; Ghaffar et al., 2019; Karaismailoglu, 2017). Still, this genotoxic potential is not exclusive to this pesticide, as the fluorinated pyrethroids λ-cyhalothrin and cyfluthrin have also shown the capacity to cause DNA and chromosomal damage, including in occupationally exposed humans (Amaeze et al., 2020; Barrón Cuenca et al.,"
,,". Concluding remarks
Fluorine chemistry has been revolutionizing the synthesis and mass production of fine chemicals with clinical, agricultural and industrial relevancy. Specifically in the case of the agrochemical sector, the remarkable advents observed in fluorine chemistry have allowed manufacturers to explore new pesticide formulae containing fluorine that, at a first glance, seem to represent a new generation of biocides with improved performances (thus requiring a lower input of these products in crops), prolonged residual activity and putative ecological safety (associated with their biological inertness), while also being less expensive to the end user.

This apparent ecological safety, which seems to be consensual among key stakeholders within the agrochemical sector (Kyzer and Martens, 2021), is particularly emphasized in cases where the synthesis of fluorinated pesticides follows a biomimetic rationale. Presumably, the design of tailor-made agrochemicals following such approach yields effective pesticides highly specific to physiological targets of their corresponding pests, reducing the impacts on non-target organisms and, consequently, their toxicity spectrum. While it is true that in some cases fluorinated pesticides may showcase safer ecotoxicological profiles, especially when compared with some legacy organochlorine pesticides (Martins et al., 2020), that should not serve as a proxy of their overall eco-friendliness. It is undeniable that many fluorinated pesticides typically correspond to lipophilic molecules capable of preserving their structural integrity for long periods of time and of conserving their biocidal activities. Thus, broad generalizations concerning their safety should be approached carefully, as this group of compounds may share a similar “Achilles’ heel” as other legacy fluoroorganics that were once prematurely flagged as safe or inert chemicals (e.g., CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs, perfluoroalkyl compounds). While it is a fact that some fluoroorganic pesticides are liable to biodegradation, it is also true that their microbial catabolism is highly redundant and unproductive, often involving incomplete biodegradation processes that yield complex (often still fluorinated) sub-products, many of which may still hold potential for non-target toxicity (Ji et al., 2020; Lava et al., 2021). Furthermore, although the biomimetic potential of fluorine substitution may allow narrowing the intended bioactivity of a given pesticide, it can also trigger the emergence of unwanted interactions with secondary targets that ultimately transpire into prominent ecotoxicological effects.

Truthfully, current literature available on this topic does not provide enough information to address fluorinated pesticides as a particular group of pesticides that are safer for the environment. In fact, the enhanced bioaccumulation potential and the nefarious ecotoxic effects in which many fluorinated pesticides have been implicated seem to suggest otherwise. Despite their undisputed attractiveness for the agrochemical market, these pesticides display a set of features that can turn them into aggressive environmental pollutants which, combined with their widespread environmental distribution, forecast an array of impacts at the ecosystem level. However, these implications are still largely unknown, and more studies are needed for proper handling and legislation of these pesticides. With a probable upcoming surge of novel pesticide formulae containing fluorinated signatures, regulatory institutions should make their best efforts to properly assess the environmental risks of fluorinated pesticides, while also vetting the potential impacts of those that are already in circulation nowadays. On the other hand, future research ventures should be centred on lifting the veil on the ecological implications associated with the increasing use and environmental distribution of these pesticides, as well as on the human exposure dynamics that may be associated, to enable a robust scientific basis to support future regulatory actions.

,,"Abstract
Pesticides constitute an integral part of modern agriculture. However, there are still concerns about their effects on non-target organisms. To address this the European Commission has imposed a stringent regulatory scheme for new pesticide compounds. Assessment of the aquatic toxicity of pesticides is based on a range of advanced tests. This does not apply to terrestrial ecosystems, where the toxicity of pesticides on soil microorganisms, is based on an outdated and crude test (N mineralization). This regulatory gap is reinforced by the recent methodological and standardization advances in soil microbial ecology. The inclusion of such standardized tools in a revised risk assessment scheme will enable the accurate estimation of the toxicity of pesticides on soil microorganisms and on associated ecosystem services. In this review we (i) summarize recent work in the assessment of the soil microbial toxicity of pesticides and point to ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms (AOM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) as most relevant bioindicator groups (ii) identify limitations in the experimental approaches used and propose mitigation solutions, (iii) identify scientific gaps and (iv) propose a new risk assessment procedure to assess the effects of pesticides on soil microorganisms.

1 Introduction
The use of pesticides is still considered a cornerstone of modern agriculture, despite major concerns about their undesirable effects on environment and human health. Soil is the main sink for pesticides used in agriculture. Upon their application, pesticides interact with soil microorganisms with the outcome of this interaction being pesticide toxicity to the soil microbiota or growth-linked microbial degradation of the pesticide"
,,"toxicity to the soil microbiota or growth-linked microbial degradation of the pesticide, depending on a range of biotic and abiotic factors (Fig. 1). Potential toxicity effects on soil microorganisms often appears as a result of the exposure of soil microbiota to pesticide levels that they cannot effectively dissipate. This leads to a significant change in the rate of different microbial processes associated with ecosystem services. Conversely, the growth-linked microbial degradation of pesticides is driven by “specialist microbes” that often constitute a small fraction of the soil microbiota [1, 2] and carry specific enzymes for the degradation of these compounds. Classic examples of pesticide classes which are prone to growth-linked microbial degradation, often rendering them inefficient for pest control, are organophosphates [3, 4], carbamates [5], triazines [6], dicarboxamides [7] and substituted phenylureas [8].

,,"Globally, the placement in the market of pesticide compounds is under the control of a regulatory framework, which should be regularly updated to meet the growing public concern about the frequent detection of residual pesticide levels in fresh produce [9], water resources [10] and soil [11] and to incorporate methodological and knowledge advances. At the European Union (EU) level, the placement of pesticides (plant protection products) in the market is dictated by the Regulation 1107/2009. All pesticides should go through a tedious procedure of tests, described in detail in Regulation 1107/2009, which aim to determine (a) the level of environmental exposure stemming from the agricultural use of plant protection products containing these pesticide compounds and (b) the toxicity or ecotoxicity of pesticides to organisms from different trophic levels. The direct comparison between environmental exposure and ecotoxicity constitutes the backbone of pesticide environmental risk assessment [12].

Today, a set of standardized ecotoxicity tests supporting the risk assessment are in place to assess the toxicity of pesticides on aquatic organisms and soil fauna, unlike soil microorganisms, whose ecotoxicological response to pesticides has not been set as a priority in the current risk assessment framework. This is surprising if we consider the number of key ecosystem services provided by microorganisms in soil. A non-exhaustive list of such services includes their role in: (i) nutrient cycling, modulating soil fertility [13]; (ii) increasing plant tolerance to biotic (pests and diseases) and abiotic (drought, salinity) stressors [14]; (iii) the uptake of nutrients by plants, hence promoting plant growth and agricultural productivity [15]; (iv) the maintenance of soil structure [16]. In response to this, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) verified the presence of regulatory gaps in the assessment of the toxicity of pesticides on soil microorganisms and identified soil microbes as a possible specific protection goal to avoid undesirable effects on ecosystem services [17]. Despite that, the assessment of the toxicity of pesticides on soil microorganisms at a regulatory level is still performed with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Test No. 216 (Soil Microorganisms: Nitrogen Transformation Test) [18], which offers a combined measurement of ammonification and nitrification rate in soil.

All the above highlight the need for a scheme to assess the toxicity of pesticides on soil microorganisms. This should consider the recent impressive methodological advances in soil microbial ecology coinciding with the upsurge of methods standardization. Still there seems to be a major lag (of almost 10 years for each step) between methods development, standardization and implementation in the regulatory process. In response to all these advances, EFSA [19] issued a scientific opinion regarding the state of the science on risk assessment of plant protection products for in-soil organisms, where several suggestions regarding the toxicity of pesticides on the soil microbiota were put forward. Some of the proposed suggestions were controversial for the reasons described below: (i) the N transformation test is inclusive and should be retained as part of pesticide toxicity testing, despite being a rather crude and outdated approach. It was further suggested that the specific test should be upgraded to a dose response assay as it is applied for non-agrochemicals [19]; (ii) the new molecular methods provide a high resolution analysis of the soil microbiota, but they are still not considered standardized for use in environmental risk assessment, although the list of standards from the International Organization of Standardization (ISO) in soil microbial ecology has tripled in the last 15 years including molecular tools like direct soil DNA extraction (ISO 11063), q-PCR analysis of the abundance microbial groups (ISO 17601) etc. (Table 1); (iii) functional microbial endpoints are more relevant for environmental risk assessment compared to microbial diversity endpoints; and (iv) arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are good potential bioindicators for assessing the soil microbial toxicity of pesticides, but other key functional microbial groups like ammonia-oxidizing microbes (AOM) might be equally good or even more appropriate toxicity bioindicators for reasons explained further in the paper (see Section 3.3).

Table 1:"
,,"2 Factors controlling pesticides toxicity on the soil microbiota
Several factors determine the potential of a pesticide compound to be toxic on the soil microbiota including: (a) compound chemical structure, (b) pesticide mode of action and the target organism, (c) dose rates applied, and (d) mode of application.

Chemical structure has a major influence on the ecotoxicological profile of pesticides, either directly through the association of certain chemical moieties with the toxicity of pesticides on soil microorganisms or indirectly through its effects on the physicochemical properties of the given compound (water solubility, lipophilicity, etc.) that determine its bioavailability and persistence. Direct structure – toxicity relationships have been shown for pesticides and aquatic or terrestrial macro-organisms [20, 21]. These have acted as the basis for the development of Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models used in pesticide regulatory practice mostly to estimate the potential toxicity of pesticide transformation products (TPs) [22]. In this regard, Traore et al. [23] developed an in-silico tool called TyPoL which enables the classification of pesticide compounds into different ecotoxicological groups based on a series of molecular descriptors, environmental and toxicological parameters. The EFSA guidance document on the use of the Weight of Evidence approach in scientific assessments provides a framework for integrating in silico models and read-across extrapolation methods for predicting toxicity of pesticides [24]. Such an approach has been used in the assessment of pesticide risk to aquatic organisms; on the contrary little is known about potential associations of chemical structu"
,,"The pesticide mode of action strongly affects their potential toxicity on soil microorganisms. Fungicides are expected to be inherently more toxic to soil fungi, unlike herbicides and insecticides that are not expected to be toxic to the soil microbiota [25], [26], [27]. However, deviations from this general rule are often reported. Previous studies have suggested that herbicides which act by inactivating plant enzymes like acetolacate synthase (EC 2.2.1.6) or 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.27), that have homologues in other living organisms including soil microorganisms, might exert toxicity onto soil microorganisms [28, 29]. Along this line, Thiour-Mauprivez et al. [30] proposed a mode-of-action-based assessment of the toxicity of herbicides (possibly applicable for other pesticide groups) on the soil biota by considering the enzymes targeted by each pesticide group as molecular biomarkers.

The famous statement of Paracelsus “All things are poison and nothing is without poison. Solely the dose determines that a thing is not a poison” largely applies to the interaction of pesticide with soil microorganisms where higher dose rates often induce higher inhibitory effects on the abundance and activity of soil microorganisms [31]. However, in certain studies effects of pesticides on soil microorganisms were evident only upon increase of the dose rates at levels not relevant for agricultural use [32, 33]. Exceptions to this dose-dependent response of microorganisms to pesticides have been also reported [34]. The phenomenon of hormesis, the stimulation of microbial growth upon exposure to low dose rates of pesticides, has been often responsible for deviation from dose-dependent responses [35].

Soil-applied pesticides are expected to be more potent for toxicity on soil microorganisms based on their intentional application in soil which results in higher exposure levels. Conversely, foliage applied compounds are largely intercepted by plant foliage, with the level of interception varying from 20 to 80 % according to the growth stage of the crop, thereby reducing the amount of pesticide reaching the soil and hence the exposure of soil microbiota. However, fully systematic applied chemicals like glyphosate could translocate from leaves to roots and eventually to soil contributing to the exposure of soil to pesticides [36]. Still, we should consider that the true extent of exposure of the soil microbiota to any pesticide compound, no matter the application regime followed, is strongly affected by its persistence and bioavailability in soil.

3 Key elements of a risk assessment scheme
A robust and comprehensive assessment of the risk of pesticides exerting undesirable effects on the soil microbiota should encompass the following elements: (a) an accurate estimation of the level and the duration of the exposure; (b) the use of high resolution, sensitive and, most importantly, standardized methods; (c) identification of soil microbial groups that could be used as indicators of the toxicity of pesticides on the soil microbiota; (d) a revised and novel tiered risk assessment scheme. The content of these elements will be discussed further below.

3.1 Pesticide exposure estimation
Determination of the level and the duration of the exposure should be an indispensable part of any toxicity assay. Temporal measurement of the dissipation of pesticides during any assay would define the level and the duration of exposure of the soil microbial community to the pesticide in question. Furthermore, detection and quantitation of pesticide TPs formed in soil would provide information on the potential involvement of TPs on toxicity effects observed. This is already done in the current regulatory framework, although the selection of TPs, relevant for inclusion in risk assessment, relies solely on the quantity of the TP formed (more than 10 % of the parent), excluding TPs that do not meet the 10 % rule but show high potency due to their chemical structure or mode of action. Correlation testing between the measured soil concentrations of pesticides and their TPs with temporal microbial measurements would point to the causal agent of the potential toxicity on the soil microbial community (parent vs TPs or a combination of both). Such an example is offered by the study of Vasileiadis et al. [31], who identified via correlation testing and a series of soil and in vitro tests, 3,5-dichloroaniline, the main TP of the fungicide iprodione (3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-N-(propan-2-yl)-2,4-dioxoimidazolidine-1-carboxamide) in soil, as the main driver of the toxicity observed on a range of functional microbial attributes.

3.2 Standardization of methods in soil microbial ecology
The recent methodological advances in soil microbial ecology and microbial ecotoxicology revealed a previously unprecedented microbial complexity and diversity and highlighted the multifaceted role of soil microorganisms in ecosystem functioning [35]. The methods available could be classified into: (a) functional methods, that determine the activity of enzymes, rates of microbial processes or the activity of microbial groups controlling key functions in terrestrial ecosystems; (b) diversity methods, which determine the composition of the soil microbiota operating at varying resolution from phylogenetically distinct (e.g. bacteria, archaea, fungi) to functionally distinct microbial groups (i.e. AOM, AMF, methane-oxidizing microorganisms, nitrogen-fixing bacteria, denitrifying bacteria). A key step for the implementation of these established and advanced methods in environmental risk assessment is their standardization. Standardization of functional methods is well advanced compared to the diversity methods.

Functional methods include measurements of (i) the activity of soil microbial exoenzymes involved in carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur cycling, and (ii) the rates of microbial processes like soil microbial respiration, potential nitrification or denitrification. These methods have been used in several studies for assessing the toxicity of pesticides on soil microorganisms [25, 33, 34, 38, 39]. For these methods, relevant ISO standards are available (Table 1), while at the same time high throughput approaches facilitating their rapid regulatory uptake have been developed for measuring soil microbial exoenzymes [40] and soil microbial respiration through MicroResp® [41]. However, the frequent lack of consistency in the response of these methods to pesticide exposure, appearing as effects deviating from the expected dose-dependent pattern, might be a plausible explanation for their exclusion from environmental risk assessment [42, 43].

Nucleic acid-based methods determining the abundance (DNA) or the activity (RNA) of key functional microbial groups via quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (q-PCR) and Reverse Transcription-q-PCR (RT-q-PCR), respectively, could be also considered as tools for measuring microbial functions, although they were not considered in environmental risk assessment due to lack of standardization [43]. Relatively recent advances with the development of ISO standards for direct soil DNA extraction (ISO11063-2012 replaced by ISO11063-2020) [44] and determination of the abundance of soil microbial groups via q-PCR (ISO17601) [45] addressed these concerns and paved the way for their implementation in pesticide environmental risk assessment. Several soil studies have determined effects of pesticides on the abundance of phylogenetically distinct microbial groups like bacteria, fungi or archaea or the abundance of functional microbial groups like AOM (ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms) [31, 46, 47], sulfur-oxidizing bacteria [34] and degraders of biogenic aromatic compounds [48] using q-PCR standardized protocols. Besides mere determination of microbial abundance in soils, RT-q-PCR approaches based on soil RNA offer a more sensitive measurement of the potential effects of pesticides on microbial activity, by measuring the number of mRNA transcripts of microbial genes involved in key soil microbial functions. However, only a few studies have used RT-q-PCR approaches to determine pesticide effects on soil microbial activity, mostly targeting AOM [42]. This most probably reflects the sensitivity of soil RNA to lysis during laboratory handling which often results in low recovery of gene transcripts.

Diversity methods include Phospholipid Fatty Acids Analysis (PLFAs), molecular PCR-based fingerprinting like Denaturating Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) and Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (TRFLP), and the more recent and powerful amplicon sequencing approaches. Phospholipid Fatty Acids Analysis is a well standardized method (ISO/TS29843-1 and -2) [49, 50], which provides information about the overall size and the composition of the living soil microbial community, however at a rather low phylogenetic resolution [51]. Conversely, PCR-based molecular fingerprinting or sequencing methods could provide robust phylogenetic information at family, genus or even species level, but are faced with limited standardization. The depth of phylogenetic analysis of the soil microbial community offered by these methods has increased from the lower resolution of earlier fingerprinting methods like TRFLP and DGGE [52, 53], to the higher resolution amplicon sequencing approaches or so called meta-taxonomics [54]. Denaturating Gradient Gel Electrophoresis and TRFLP, either as stand-alone approaches or in combination with clone libraries, have been heavily used in the period of 2000–2015 to determine effects of pesticides on the diversity of phylogenetically and functionally distinct microbial groups [55, 56]. However, they could not provide quantitative information for less abundant members of the soil microbiota. Since 2015, several studies have used meta-taxonomic approaches to identify effects of pesticides on the diversity of bacteria, fungi [57, 58] and functional microbial groups like AOM [31]. Benchmarking protocols for the preparation and setup of meta-taxonomic analysis of the soil bacterial (https://earthmicrobiome.org/protocols-and-standards/16s/) and fungal diversity (https://earthmicrobiome.org/protocols-and-standards/its) were developed by the Earth Microbiome Project and have been largely adopted by most recent pesticide soil ecotoxicity studies making a major step towards their formal standardization. However, what we are still missing is the standardization of the bioinformatic pipeline for the analysis of amplicon sequencing data and the way to make use of these multivariate data in a regulatory context. These issues and ways to resolve them are further discussed in Sections 4.5 and 5.1 respectively.

Thiele-Bruhn et al. [59] classified the different methods available in soil microbial ecology according to the Ecosystem Services Approach, in line with the recommendation of EFSA [19], that functional endpoints are more attainable and ready-to-implement compared to diversity endpoints. In this approach, methods, traditional and new ones, were classified according to their relevance for a list of eight ecosystem services, namely: (a) biodiversity, genetic resources, cultural services; (b) food web support; (c) biodegradation of pollutants; (d) nutrient cycling; (e) pest control and plant growth promotion; (f) carbon cycling; (g) greenhouse gas emissions; (h) soil structure formation. Most of the above-mentioned services are emanated from the same basic functions. The authors highlighted the potential of q-PCR-based methods to define, in a standardized way, pesticide effects on microbial groups performing key soil functions involved in soil fertility (nitrogen and phosphorus transformation, plant growth promotion) and environmental quality (greenhouse gas emissions, natural attenuation of pollutants). All these point towards the use of endpoints which represent a microbial function until we will be able to make use of the wealth of data derived from meta-taxonomic analysis in a standardized way and in a regulatory context.

3.3 Soil microbial indicators
A first assessment of the potential toxicity of pesticides on aquatic and terrestrial macro-organisms is performed through tests on specific organisms from different trophic levels identified as bioindicators (single species tests). A cornerstone organism for pesticide ecotoxicology is Daphnia magna, used as an indicator of aquatic invertebrates, while Onchorhynchus mykiss, Eisenia foetida, Selenastrum capricornutum and Lemna minor are used as toxicity indicators for fishes, earthworms, algae and aquatic plants, respectively [19, 60]. These bioindicators were selected based on the following criteria: (i) they have a key ecological role; (ii) they are characterized by high sensitivity to pesticides, compared to other species in the same group of organisms; (iii) they show a clear ecotoxicological response to pesticides; (iv) we have a very good knowledge of their life cycle; and (v) there are standardized tests available for the determination of their response to pesticides.

If the same logical path is to be followed for the establishment of a new framework to assess the toxicity of pesticides on soil microorganisms, new microbial groups which fulfil the above criteria should be identified to serve as candidate bioindicators. Previous studies have pointed to AOM [61], AMF [19, 33], nitrogen-fixing bacteria [62], protists [63], microalgae [64] and cyanobacteria [65], all of which are involved in key soil microbial functions as shown in Fig. 2. In the following sections we will try to describe the pros and cons of these potential bioindicator microbial groups with relevant examples from the literature.
"
,,"The responsiveness of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to pesticide exposure was evident in earlier studies [26, 66] leading to the development of the ISO-10832 standard measuring the impact of toxicants on AMF spore germination [67] (Table 1). Karpouzas et al. [33] used molecular tools to assess the toxicity of pesticides on AMF and suggested their use as potential bioindicators for assessing the toxicity of pesticides on soil microorganisms. It was only in 2017 when EFSA also suggested the inclusion of AMF as soil microbial indicators for pesticide toxicity [19]. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are the most ubiquitous plant symbiotic microbes on earth with up to 80 % of higher plants colonized by obligate biotrophic fungi of the phylum Glomeromycota [68]. They colonize plant roots and increase the capacity of the plants to acquire nutrients, especially P, and water from soil, offering plant tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress [69]. In exchange for all these benefits provided to plants, AMF derive plant photosynthates. Besides improving plant fitness, AMF also contribute to the formation and stabilization of soil aggregation [16], improve soil carbon stocks [70], contribute to nutrient exchanges between plants connected via a network of AMF mycelia, and control the composition and productivity of plant communities [71].

Several previous studies have tested the toxicity of pesticides on AMF at various experimental scales [27, 33, 72, 73]. However, certain characteristics of their lifestyle such as (i) their obligatory symbiotic nature and (ii) the succession of intraradical and extraradical life stages makes essential the use of complementary experimental approaches to be able to distinguish between direct toxicity effects on AMF vs indirect effects driven by the potential phytotoxicity of pesticides. The former is expected by fungicides, whereas indirect toxicity effects on AMF are expected by herbicides. Giovannetti et al. [66] tested 14 pesticides for their effects on spore germination and pre-symbiotic mycelial growth. They reported a higher toxicity of fungicides compared to the other pesticide groups tested. Another important issue that needs extra consideration is the differential exposure of the different life stages of AMF to pesticides. Extraradical AMF life stages are prone to pesticide exposure, compared to intraradical stages which deviate pesticide exposure, especially when non-systemic pesticides are tested. The standard ISO10832 «Effects of pollutants on mycorrhizal fungi- germination test» is using the germination of spores of Funeliformis mosseae, one of the most well studied AMF, as a relevant toxicity endpoint [67]. Mallmann et al. [74] proposed an optimization of this ISO test with the use of Gigagspora albida and Rhizophagus clarus, to cover a wider diversity of AMF, and boric acid as negative control instead of cadmium nitrate, which was initially chosen as the specific ISO standard was originally designed to assess the ecotoxicity of metals to AMF.

The toxicity of pesticides on natural assemblages of AMF has been determined in planted pot and field studies with mycorrhizal colonization of roots, phosphorus content and other plant physiological attributes (root and shoot biomass), utilized as ecotoxicological endpoints [72, 75]. These studies introduce realism and complexity in the toxicity assessment, but their outcome is affected by confounding pesticide- and AMF-related factors. This was demonstrated in a study by Karpouzas et al. [33] who observed a major decrease in the level of mycorrhizal colonization of maize roots upon repeated applications of nicosulfuron (2-{[(4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yl)carbamoyl]sulfamoyl}-N,N-dimethylpyridin-3-carboxamide) at rates higher than 10 times the recommended dose. However, it was still not possible to determine with this experimental set up the nature of the effects on AMF; direct on AMF or indirect via a possible toxicity of the herbicide nicosulfuron to the plant host. In this respect, the complementary use of in vitro tests could provide insights into the potential toxicity of pesticides on the different life stages of AMF, and hence clarify the nature of the effects observed.

Although AMF are obligatory symbionts, they could be cultivated in vitro on self-propagating mycorrhized Agrobacterium tumefaciens transfer-DNA transformed roots of Daucus carota or Medicago truncatula growing in sterilized minimal medium [76], [77], [78]. Furthermore, the flexible compartmentalization of these in vitro cultivation systems (mono-, bi- or tri-compartmental systems) allows the examination of the toxicity of pesticides at the different life stages of AMF and could provide insights into the toxicity mechanisms. In its simpler form, the mono-compartmental axenic culture system of AMF has been used to assess the toxicity of pesticides at the symbiotic phase, however the potential phytotoxicity of pesticides (e.g. herbicides) on the transformed roots cannot be excluded and might complicate results interpretation. Using this system, Wan et al. [76] first calculated Inhibitory Concentration 50 % (IC50) values for a range of pesticides using reduction in extraradical mycelium sporulation as a conservative endpoint. Benomyl (methyl [1-(butylcarbamoyl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]carbamate), chlorothalonil (benzene-2,4,5,6-tetrachloro-1,3-dicarbonitrile) and glyphosate (N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine) were the most toxic pesticides (IC50 < 1 mg/L) compared to AMPA (2-amino-3-(5-methyl-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1,2-oxazol-4-yl)propanoic acid) (IC50 = 4.2 mg/L), the major TP of glyphosate, and the botanical pesticide azadirachtin (dimethyl (2aR,2a1R,3S,4S,4aR,5S,7aS,8S,10R,10aS)-10-(acetyloxy)-3,5-dihydroxy-4-methyl-4-[(1aR,2S,3aS,6aS,7S,7aS)-6a-hydroxy-7a-methyl-3a,6a,7,7a-tetrahydro-2,7-methanofuro[2,3-b]oxireno [2,3-e]oxepin-1a(2H)-yl]-8-{[(2E)-2-methylbut-2-enoyl]oxy}octahydro-1H,7H-naphtho[1,8-bc:4,4a-c’]difuran-5,10a(8H)-dicarboxylate) (IC50 = 230 mg/L). Zocco et al. [77] first used a bi-compartmental system, composed of a root compartment and hyphae compartment, to determine the toxicity of the fungicides fenpropimorph ((2R,6S)-4-[(RS)-3‐(4‐tert-butylphenyl)‐2-methylpropyl]-2,6-dimethylmorpholine) and fenhexamid (N-(2,3-dichloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-methylcyclohexane-1-carboxamide) on the symbiotic phase, the hyphae and the spores at the post-symbiotic phase. Eventually, Dupre de Boulois et al. [79] proposed the use of a three-compartment in vitro system, composed of the root compartment and the hyphae compartment mentioned above, plus a shoot compartment where a plantlet was allowed to grow. These systems were used to test the toxicity of fenpropimorph and fenhexamid on the capacity of extraradical hyphae and spores to colonize roots, while they offer the opportunity to determine effects on phosphorus uptake using 33P [77]. These tri-compartmental in vitro systems could be further modified to include a second shoot compartment associated with the hyphae compartment addressing the effect of pesticides on the capacity of extraradical hyphae to sporulate and colonize plant crops where the pesticide tested is destined for use [73]. Besides determination of the toxicity of pesticides on AMF, Campagnac et al. [80] used the bi-compartmental assay to disentangle the pesticide toxicity mechanisms on AMF. They showed that the toxicity of fenpropimorph on AMF was the result of its inhibitory effect on the sterol biosynthesis of mycorrhized plantlets. Similarly, Zocco et al. [78] used the tri-compartmental system to define the toxicity mechanism of the same two fungicides on the phosphorus uptake machinery.

The delayed implementation of PCR-based molecular methods in AMF research, changed dramatically the taxonomy of Glomeromycota [81]. To date, a limited number of studies have used molecular approaches to disentangle the effects of pesticides on the diversity of AMF, with the focus being on the intraradical rather than on the soil reservoir of Glomeromycota. Karpouzas et al. [33] used a combinatory DGGE – cloning approach to study the effects of nicosulfuron on the intraradical AMF community and noted a dramatic decrease in the diversity of AMF in maize roots when the herbicide was applied at levels which were approximating ×10 the recommended dose. A more recent study explored the effect of pesticide mixtures (fenhexamid, folpet (2-trichloromethylsulfanyl)-1H-isoindole-1,3(2H)-dione) and deltamethrin ((S)-cyano(3-phenoxy)methyl (1R,3R)-3-(2,2-bromothenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane-1-carboxylate) on the soil diversity of AMF via clone library with taxon-specific primers [27]. They observed a reduction of AMF soil diversity with increasing dose rates. Jin et al. [75] was the first and only study to date that investigated the effects of pesticides on the intraradical AMF diversity using meta-taxonomics. They noted pesticide-specific effects, with Gigaspora hoi and Acalauspora uera showing increasing sensitivity to fludioxonil in pea and chickpea respectively.

Overall, AMF could be considered as potential microbial indicators for the soil microbial toxicity of pesticides based on (i) their key role in soil ecosystem functions, (ii) our good knowledge of their life cycle and biology, (iii) their overall high sensitivity to pesticides, and (iv) the availability of standardized tools to define effects of pesticides on their growth, although efforts are in progress to improve the existing ISO-10832 method and/or to develop new standards for AMF toxicity testing. Still their obligate symbiotic nature stresses the need for use of combinatory approaches including both in vitro and soil-plant tests to define in a comprehensive way the true extent of pesticide toxicity. Despite their high responsiveness to pesticides, we are still missing studies assessing the sensitivity of AMF to pesticides comparatively with other microbial groups characterized as potent bioindicators. Such studies will be particularly useful in the quest for identifying optimum microbial indicators for assessing the soil microbial toxicity of pesticides. A recent paper provides an industry perspective for the use of AMF in pesticide risk assessment; it highlights limitations of currently available methods for AMF (from in vitro to field testing) and proposes adjustments to improve clarity in the interpretation of the results, and highlights knowledge gaps that should be addressed for a meaningful AMF-based assessment of the toxicity of pesticides on soil microorganisms [82].

3.3.2 Ammonia-oxidizers and other nitrogen cycling microorganisms
Nitrification annual contribution to soil N is particularly high and has been estimated to reach 330 Tg (or 330 · 1012 g) of N [83]. Hence perturbations in its operation would adversely affect N balance in soil. Ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms control the rate limiting step of nitrification, which involves the oxidation of ammonia to hydroxylamine [83]. This is further transformed to nitrite through the intermediate formation of nitrogen monoxide (NO) [84]. Subsequently, dioxidonitrate(1-) (nitrite) is further oxidized to trioxidonitrate(1-) (nitrate) by nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) [85]. Apart from their direct involvement in ammonia oxidation, AOM was relatively recently shown to contribute to the production of dinitrogen oxide (N2O), a major greenhouse gas, through a process called nitrifiers denitrification [86]. Ammonia oxidation is performed by a phylogenetically narrow group of microorganisms with new players discovered in the last 20 years like: (i) ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), mostly belonging to β-proteobacteria and specifically to Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira [87]; (ii) ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) belonging to the phylum Thaumarcheota with lineages Nitrososphaerales and Nitrosotaleales, dominating in neutral to alkaline and acidic soils, respectively [88]; and (iii) comammox bacteria which perform the full nitrification process in a single cell [89]. The latter group is abundant in terrestrial ecosystems; however, their active participation in ammonia oxidation in soil was only recently proven [90]. Still representatives of this group are yet to be isolated from soil. Soil physicochemical properties, like pH [91] and ammonia concentration levels, exert a strong niche specialization effect on AOM. Ammonia-oxidizing archaea dominate in acidic soils, whereas AOB become dominant in neutral to alkaline soils [92]. Similarly, high ammonia concentrations in soil generally favor AOB, while AOA and comammox bacteria prefer oligotrophic ammonia conditions [93]. All autotrophic AOM possess a periplasmic enzyme called ammonia monooxygenase which is responsible for the oxidation of ammonia to hydroxylamine [83]. The gene encoding the alpha subunit of ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) has been used as a gene marker for the phylogenetic classification of AOM [85, 86]. This gene has been used for the design of group-specific primers that have been utilized for the measurement of the abundance, activity and diversity of AOA, AOB and comammox bacteria in soil [31, 94], [95], [96].

Domsch [97] first reported the high sensitivity of Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter to pesticides. This initial observation was verified by recent studies which reinforced the potential high sensitivity of AOM to abiotic stressors, including pesticides [59]. Several studies have explored the response of AOM to pesticide exposure by measuring their abundance (q-PCR) [98], [99], [100], their activity (potential nitrification or inorganic nitrogen pools) [42], and their diversity via DGGE, TRFLP and meta-taxonomic analysis of the amoA gene [31, 32, 101]. Hund-Rinke et al. [102] tested the toxicity of silver nanoparticles, as potential pesticides, on soil microorganisms using a range of standardized methods including potential nitrification (or so-called potential ammonia-oxidation method ISO-15685 [103]), MicroResp®, and exoenzymes activity. All tests showed a similar sensitivity towards the tested nano-pesticide. However, potential nitrification showed the most consistent concentration–effect response, compared to the other two methods tested were results were more variable and weaker concentration-effect relationships were observed. Similar studies have also reported the sensitivity of potential nitrification to pesticide exposure [104]. Potential nitrification is a measure of the rate of the microbial transformation of ammonia to nitrite, in contrast to the nitrogen mineralization test which is a combined measurement of ammonification and nitrification compromising its sensitivity to abiotic stressors. As all potential rate assays, potential nitrification has limited ecological relevance and it is inherently biased towards specific microbial groups (e.g. AOB); hence, its use in studying the ecology of AOM is severely restricted [105]. However, when it is used in a purely ecotoxicological context, it remains a valuable tool, especially its ISO standard (ISO-15685) [103], which could be readily included in the battery of tests used to assess the soil microbial toxicity of pesticides.

Besides the effects of pesticides on the abundance of AOM, only a few studies have looked at effects at the transcription level. Papadopoulou et al. [42] showed that ethoxyquin (6-ethoxy-2,2,4-trimethyl-1,2-dihydroquinoline), an antioxidant used for the control of apple scald in fruit-packaging plants, had a temporal inhibitory effect on AOM which became evident only when amoA transcripts were monitored. Considering the high turnover rates of RNA in soil, RNA-based approaches provide a more in-depth analysis of the effects of pesticides on functional microbial groups like AOM. However, the labile nature of RNA has precluded its wider use in pesticide microbial ecotoxicological studies and maybe its use could be considered when refinement of the ecotoxicological part of the risk assessment is requested. Overall, AOM constitute very appealing bioindicators for the assessment of the toxicity of pesticides on soil microorganisms as they (i) control a very significant function in soil nitrogen cycling, (ii) are sensitive to pesticide exposure providing an ecotoxicologically relevant response, (iii) are well studied regarding their life cycle, ecology, biochemistry and physiology, and (iv) could be monitored at abundance and activity levels using already available standardized methods. In addition, previous studies have also indicated that AOM measured endpoints like potential nitrification and AOM abundance were the most sensitive endpoints amongst several tested [34, 102, 104].

Other nitrogen cycling microbial groups, besides AOM, have been considered responsive to pesticide exposure like denitrifying bacteria [106] and nitrogen-fixing bacteria [62]. Both these groups are involved in greenhouse gas emissions and nitrogen soil sequestration, hence their perturbation by pesticides might affect key ecosystem services [59]. Several recent studies have monitored the effects of pesticides on the abundance of denitrifying bacteria through q-PCR analysis of bacterial genes involved in the different steps of denitrification, however no clear ecotoxicological response to pesticide exposure was evident [34, 106, 107]. Pesticide effects on nitrogen-fixing bacteria have been also explored, via nifH-based q-PCR, with the results varying from no inhibition by trifluralin (2,6-dinitro-N,N-dipropyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)aniline) [108], to transient inhibition by chlorothalonil [109], and to strong inhibition by 1,3-dichloroprop-1-ene [110].

3.3.3 Protists
Protists are the most ubiquitous soil eukaryotes spanning the entire eukaryotic tree of life [111], and encompass a range of lifestyles including phagotrophs, phototrophs, saprotrophs and symbionts [112]. The abundance of protists in soil varies from 104 to 108 g−1 of soil [113] and their community composition is mostly driven by soil moisture [114] and to a lesser extent by the prokaryotic microbial composition, in line with the bacterivore feeding regime of certain soil protists. Other confounding soil factors that seem to act as major drivers of the prokaryotic communities, like pH [13], are not particularly important for soil protists, except for parasitic whose composition is driven by the pH preferences of their hosts [115].

Heterotrophic soil protists, traditionally called protozoa, have attracted attention as potential indicators of soil pollution. They are categorized into five morphologically distinct groups: naked and testate amoebae, flagellates, ciliates and parasitic Sporozoa [63]. They were previously considered as solely bacterivores, however recent studies have shown that they are omnivores feeding on fungi [116], algae [117], other protists [118] and even small size animals like nematodes and rotifers [119]. High-throughput sequencing analysis of the composition of the soil protists suggested that consumers (i.e. predatory protists) constitute the dominant functional group in most soils around the globe [114]. The capacity of soil protists to prey on a wide range of soil prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms leads to the efficient turn-over of nutrients from microbial biomass [120]. This enriches soil with previously unattainable nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus that could be taken up by plants supporting enhanced plant growth [112].

Foissner [63], in a first review, proposed the use of heterotrophic soil protists as indicators of environmental perturbations in the soil ecosystem. This suggestion was based on certain characteristics which are considered desirable for such bioindicators: (i) they constitute ubiquitous microorganisms in soil, (ii) they have key ecological roles in nutrients recycling and in the control of other prokaryotic and eukaryotic soil organisms, (iii) they are characterized by rapid growth which ensures their rapid reaction to environmental perturbations. On the other hand there are restrictive factors for their potential use as bioindicators: (i) testing of heterotrophic soil protists requires the presence of relevant prey organisms, while effects of pollutants on the prey and/or the predator might complicate the interpretation of the results; (ii) enumeration using non molecular tools is not well established and still relies on time consuming dilution culture techniques; (iii) there are no standardized methods to assess the effects of pollutants on protists; (iv) taxonomic classification until recently relied on morphological features of protists which is a daunting task considering their enormous morphological variation and the limited number of specialized taxonomists. The recent development and optimization of high-throughput amplicon sequencing approaches for protists revealed an enormous diversity, similar to prokaryotic microorganisms, in soil [121], [122], [123].

Only a few in vitro and soil microcosm studies have explored pesticide effects on soil protists. Schreiber and Brink [124] used an in vitro assay with the ciliates Colpoda cucullus and Blepharisma undulans and the flagellate Oikomonas termo fed on Enterobacter aerogenes to determine the toxicity of MCPA (4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy)acetic acid), dichloprop ((2R)-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)propanoic acid), clorpyralid (3,6-dichloropyridine-2-carboxylic acid), benomyl (methyl [1-(butylcarbamoyl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]carbamate) and fenvalerate ((RS)-cyano(3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl (RS)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-methylbutyrate) in axenic and non-axenic cultures. They calculated 9h-Lethal Concentration 50 % (LC50) and Lethal Concentration 10 % (LC10) based on the reduction in the turbidity of the culture and noted that some of the chemicals could be toxic to soil protists at rates similar to the recommended dose rates. More recently, Amacker et al. [65] devised an in vitro assay for testing the toxicity of pesticides on the testate amoeba Euglypha rotunda growing in co-culture with Escherichia coli. They validated this assay with the herbicide metolachlor (chloro-N-(2-ethyl-6-methylphenyl)-N-[(2RS)-1-methoxypropan-2-yl]acetamide) and observed non-linear effects on the tested protist, a problem often encountered in pesticide ecotoxicity studies that prevents the calculation of toxicity units (e.g. EC50). A common feature in all in vitro tests is the inclusion of controls testing the potential toxicity of pesticides on the co-cultured bacteria. This is essential to distinguish between direct toxic effects of the pesticides on the protist or indirect effects stemming from the lack of feed (toxic to the bacterial prey). Ekelund [125] tested, in small soil microcosms (5 g), the toxicity of the fungicide fenpropimorph on soil protists via enumeration of flagellates, naked amoeba, ciliates and other amoeba. They noted a feeding-specific effect of the fungicide on soil protists with bacterivorous flagellates and naked amoeba being sensitive to fenpropimorph, unlike ciliates and other amoeba that were not affected. The lack of any effect on fungal hyphae provided a further proof of direct toxicity of the fungicide to soil protists.

In recent years, the effects of pesticides on soil protist diversity could be studied using amplicon sequencing with primers targeting soil eukaryotes [116]. Still only a few ecotoxicological studies have used this approach. Carley et al. [126] tested the toxicity of Cu(OH)2 nanopesticide on the microbial community in soil and water/sediment mesocosms. They observed no significant effects of the copper nanopesticide on the soil microbiota (bacteria, fungi, microeukaryotes), while individual protist groups like Cercozoa were negatively affected by the Cu(OH)2 nanopesticide. Fournier et al. [127] tested the effect of a synthetic (propamocarb (propyl 3-(dimethylamino)propylcarbamate) + fosetyl Aluminium (aluminium tris(ethyl phosphonate)) and of a microbial pesticide (Clonostachys rosea f. catenulate) on the composition of the soil bacterial, fungal and protist community. They noted, via network co-occurrence analysis, that the synthetic pesticide affected keystone fungal and protist ASVs suggesting a broader effect on the biotic interactions between these two microbial groups. These studies suggest that the effects of pesticides on the diversity of protists should be always examined in comparison with interacting microbial (bacteria, fungi) and animal (nematodes) soil populations. Using this approach results of pesticide toxicity could be investigated at the soil-food web level, moving away from the single microbial group perspective, the focus of most soil ecotoxicity assays. Overall, soil protists could be good potential candidate bioindicators of the soil microbial toxicity of pesticides. Still in vitro and in soil experimental protocols should be developed and standardized before their use and implementation in the pesticide regulatory framework.

3.3.4 Other microbial groups as potential bioindicators
Photosynthetic microorganisms like micro-algae and cyanobacteria have been often used as indicators of the toxicity of pesticides in aquatic ecosystems [128]. However, the value of these microorganisms in soil ecosystems has been overlooked. Micro-algae and cyanobacteria are ubiquitous colonizers of topsoil [129] that contribute to several soil ecosystem services like (i) support to soil fertility through N2 and CO2 fixation [130] and (ii) stabilization of soil aggregates [131], which results in reduced soil erosion and limited losses of water and nutrients [132]. Despite their major functional role in soil, their use in the assessment of the soil microbial ecotoxicity of pesticides was not explored. Pipe [133], after reviewing studies looking at the effects of pesticides on soil cyanobacteria and micro-algae, suggested that herbicides, especially those which act on the photosynthetic machinery of plants, are more toxic to these microbial groups compared to insecticides and fungicides.

Considering the main role of cyanobacteria on nitrogen fixation in rice paddy fields [134], the effect of rice pesticides on cyanobacteria has attracted attention [135]. Beyond rice cultivation, little is known about the potential toxicity of pesticides on cyanobacteria in other agricultural settings. Crouzet et al. [136] investigated the dose–response effects of the herbicide mesotrione (rac-2-[4-(methanesulfonyl)-2-nitrobenzoyl]cyclohexane-1,3-dione), acting as a competitive inhibitor of 4-hydroxyphenyl-pyruvate-dioxygenase involved in the biosynthesis of photosynthetic pigments, on soil photosynthetic microbial communities (particularly cyanobacteria) using a microcosm approach. Mesotrione induced significant decreases on the photosynthetic biomass at dose rates 10 times the recommended, while structural effects on the cyanobacterial community were evident only at higher dose rates. More recently, Crouzet et al. [137] studied the effects of isoproturon (N′-[4-(propanol-2-yl)phenyl]-N,N-dimethylurea), a substituted phenylurea herbicide known to be a photosynthesis inhibitor, on soil microalgae and cyanobacteria and their soil aggregation capacity. They noted that the herbicide negatively impacted the soil microalgal community, resulting in a significant decrease of the size of the conventional soil aggregates. These studies put forward these functional microbial groups (algae and cyanobacteria) as promising bioindicators for deciphering the impacts of pesticides on soil functions (e.g. soil aggregation) in agroecosystems.

3.4 A new risk assessment scheme and tests required for the determination of the toxicity of pesticides on soil microorganisms
3.4.1 A new risk assessment scheme proposed
Environmental risk assessment of pesticides relies on a tiered system composed of tiers of increasing complexity and realism. Tier I is based on the assessment of the toxicity using highly conservative assays. If risk assessment indicates potential undesirable effects at this step of the process, then assessment is performed at Tiers II and III, which are characterized by less conservative and more realistic assays at both exposure and toxicity level. This tiered scheme is the backbone of the current environmental risk assessment of pesticides, but this is not yet applicable to soil microorganisms. Earlier studies in the late 70s provided the first experimental guidelines on how to determine the toxicity of pesticides on soil microorganisms [25, 138]. They suggested that if significant inhibitory effects are observed at lab scale, the toxicity of pesticides on soil microorganisms should be further explored at field scale. Following the same philosophy, Karpouzas et al. [139] proposed a similar tiered system for the assessment of the soil microbial toxicity of pesticides. Their approach was composed of three tiers of increasing complexity based on the ecotoxicological response of key soil functional groups like AOM and AMF or others which remain to be defined (Fig. 3): (i) a Tier I in vitro screening of pesticides against a set of soil-derived AOM and AMF strains that cover the different ecophysiological and phylogenetic variants of these microbial groups; (ii) a Tier II toxicity assessment in lab soil microcosms (or planted pot studies when AMF are considered) against natural assemblages of AOM and AMF; and (iii) a Tier III toxicity assessment at field scale (under cropping conditions) against natural assemblages of AOM and AMF. In cases where an unacceptable risk for soil microorganisms is still evident, refinement of exposure could be an option to minimize risk.
"
,,"Single species tests constitute the first and most conservative step in the assessment of the toxicity of pesticides on soil organisms. In vitro testing of the toxicity of pesticides on soil microorganisms could be an equivalent first tier assay against bioindicator organisms like AMF and AOM. However, this approach has not been used in soil microbial ecotoxicology most probably due to: (a) the bacterial species concept which remains elusive due to their different evolution rates driven by horizontal gene transfer and high rates of homologous recombination [140]; (b) the complexity of soil microbiota which prevented until recently the identification of ecotoxicologically relevant soil microbial species: and (c) the poor culturability of the majority of soil microorganisms in currently available growth media. In vitro assays have been utilized to determine the toxicity mechanism and calculate toxicity endpoints for AMF, as has been described earlier in this review [77, 78, 80].

Unlike AMF, in vitro testing has not been largely explored for other soil functional microbial groups like AOM which have shown sensitivity to pesticides. In vitro cultivation of soil derived AOB and AOA is a rather difficult task. This is mirrored in the very limited number of currently available pure cultures [88]. In vitro assays with soil derived AOB and AOA have been mostly used to determine the activity of synthetic [141], [142], [143] and biological nitrification inhibitors [144, 145]. Such studies allow the calculation of Effective Concentration 50 % (EC50) values based on the measurement of NO2 production or growth of AOM by q-PCR. However, in most studies to date, growth and activity measurements seem to concur [142, 146], suggesting that inhibition levels on AOM could be determined just by simply measuring NO2 formation. Vasileiadis et al. [31] first used in vitro assays to test the toxicity of iprodione and its main TP, 3,5-dichloroaniline on (i) two AOA isolates Candidatus Nitrosocosmicus frankladianus and Candidatus Nitrosotalea sinensis occupying contrasting ecological niches and representing widely distributed neutrophilic and acidophilic AOA lineages, respectively [147, 148], (ii) an AOB Nitrosospira multiformis, with members of Nitrospira sp. being dominant among the AOB community in terrestrial ecosystems [149]. More recently Papadopoulou et al. [142] used in vitro assays to determine the effect of ethoxyquin, its two main TPs quinone imine (4-iminocyclohexa-2,5-dien‐1-one) and dimethyl-ethoxyquinoline (6-ethoxy-2,4-dimethylquinoline), and of other nitrification inhibitors on the same AOM isolates plus Nitrosomonas europaea. Based on the calculation of EC50 values, it was demonstrated that there is a high inhibitory activity of ethoxyquin and quinone imine on AOA but not on AOB. This in vitro approach could be adopted for assessing the toxicity of pesticides on other functional soil microbial guilds like nitrogen-fixing bacteria and NOB.

In vitro tests are overall fast track, simple to undertake and readily adjusted to high-throughput versions. Still certain aspects of these test should be standardized with the most important being the selection of soil-derived strains per functional microbial guild that would be included in pesticide testing. The strains included in such ecotoxicity assays should fulfill certain criteria like (a) they should show an ecotoxicologically relevant response to pesticide exposure (dose-dependent response) and (b) they should cover a range of ecotypes like r- and k-strategists (i.e. AMF) or acidophilic and neutrophilic/alkaliphilic AOM or AOM favored under contrasting ammonium soil levels. Preliminary tests with selected members of these microbial guilds will pave the way for the standardization of these tests. It should be mentioned here that in vitro microbial testing, as all Tier I tests, should be considered as a simplified tests of low ecological relevance but it is still useful to get a first assessment of the potential toxicity of pesticides on the soil microbiota.

3.4.3 In soil tests with natural or inoculated microbial assemblages
In cases where in vitro assays indicate that toxicity levels exceed threshold values, further soil microcosm or mesocosm tests should be employed to determine toxicity under more realistic conditions. Soil laboratory tests could be of variable size, spanning from a small mass of soil (5 to 100 g) to pot studies where plants are cultivated under controlled conditions (2 to 5 kg soil). The presence of plants is indispensable in studies looking at pesticide effects on AMF. The dose rates tested could be selected based on the OECD 216 test (e.g. 1 time, 2 times, 10 times the recommended dose rate) or a dose-dependent application scheme could be followed.

Effects of pesticide at microcosm or mesocosm tests could be determined at the level of natural microbial assemblages using measurements of abundance, activity or diversity endpoints. Alternatively, pesticide effects could be examined in more controlled soil systems that have been sterilized with mild sterilization methods (i.e. γ-irradiation or fumigation) and the microbial community has been reinstated either with inoculation of mock microbial communities of known composition and complexity [56] or with more complex microbial inocula derived from serial dilutions of the microbiota collected from the original soil before its sterilization [150]. The composition of the diluted soil microbiota could be determined via amplicon sequencing [151] and further manipulated i.e. by selectively removing fractions of the soil microbiota through various treatments like the application of antibiotics or filtration to determine pesticide effects on a specific soil microbial guild without confounding microbial interactions. Such approaches could serve as potential refinement assays to examine the toxicity of pesticides on specific components of the microbial community without having the limitations of in vitro assays and the overall complexity of soil microcosms.

In case an unacceptable toxicity effect of pesticides on soil microorganisms is identified at lab microcosm or pot studies, toxicity is evaluated at field level. At these experimental scales pesticide toxicity applies solely on natural microbial assemblages. Regardless of the experimental scale considered (microcosm, pot or field) pesticide dissipation and transformation should be determined on a temporal basis enabling the identification of the toxicant (parent vs TP).

4 Open issues and knowledge gaps
4.1 Low-risk pesticides
The growing public concern about the effects of synthetic pesticides on environmental quality and soil health, has shifted attention to low-risk pesticides. However, their introduction in pesticide market has been hampered by the stringency of the current EU regulatory framework which treats low-risk pesticides in the same way as synthetic ones [152, 153]. This is reflected in the much lower number of low-risk pesticides reaching the market in Europe compared to USA, China, Brazil and India [154]. Low-risk pesticides is a broad group which encompasses (a) microbials, where the active agent is a microorganism that protects crops from fungal and insect infestations; (b) natural products or biochemicals or botanicals and peptides, that are biogenic compounds, products of the secondary metabolism of plants and microorganisms, with strong biocidal activity; (c) semiochemicals, including pheromones and allelochemicals, that are emitted by animals, plants and other organisms and impose a physiological or behavioral response in individuals of the same species or other species respectively [155]; and (d) double stranded RNA (dsRNA)-based pesticides that work through the natural gene silencing RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism of several living organisms [156]. Their mode of action is based on gene-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) or microRNA (miRNA) molecules that bind on mRNA with complementary nucleotide sequences and trigger their lysis, hence preventing protein production [157]. Prevention of the biosynthesis of proteins involved in the pathogenesis of pests or pathogens could lead to plant protection.

As their name indicates, low-risk pesticides are characterized as safe and environmentally friendly solutions, mostly due to their biological origin. However, hard evidence to verify their low-risk character is scarce. Amongst natural products, azadirachtin is the hallmark compound of this group. It is one of the most studied low-risk pesticide regarding its off-target toxicity to soil microorganisms and the results obtained to date do not support a low-risk profile. Azadirachtin showed low in vitro toxicity towards AMF, compared to synthetic pesticides [76]. This was not verified in soil studies, where the recommended dose of azadirachtin negatively affected the abundance and the transcriptional activity of AOM, nitrogen-fixing and denitrifying bacteria [98, 158] and reduced the diversity of bacteria, fungi and AMF [56, 99]. In the same study, azadirachtin showed equivalent or stronger inhibitory effects than the synthetic pesticides tested. When looking at semiochemicals, little is known regarding the off-target toxicity of pheromones to the soil microbiota, as expected due to their volatile nature that precludes exposure of soil microorganisms. On the other hand, there are a few studies looking at the effects of allelochemicals acting as herbicides on the soil microbiota. Hence, Romdhane et al. [29] compared the effects of the allelochemical β-triketone herbicide leptospermone (2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-6-(3-methylbutanoyl) cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) and its synthetic derivative sulcotrione (2-[2-chloro-4-(methanesulfonyl)benzoyl]cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) on the soil microbial community. In line with the results of azadirachtin, leptospermone induced stronger changes in the soil bacterial community composition than sulcotrione. These studies certainly challenge the general perception that natural products are characterized by lower off-target toxicity compared to synthetic pesticides.

In accordance with the other low-risk pesticide groups, little is known regarding the potential effects of microbial pesticides on the soil microbiota. Potential toxicity effects of microbials on the soil microbial community largely depend on the mode of action of the microbial pesticide itself. Hence microbial pesticides based on microorganisms which do not act through the production of biocidal compounds are not generally expected to affect soil microorganisms. This was clearly the case for the nematode parasitic fungi Paracoccus lilacinus strain PL251, which did not have a direct inhibitory effect on AOM [101]. In contrast Yu et al. [159], using a different P. lilacinus strain PL1210, showed strong inhibitory effects on nitrification and AOM abundance, which were attributed to antimicrobial metabolites that the tested strain produces. Other relevant studies also suggested that microbial pesticides based on microorganisms acting through parasitism or antagonism (i.e. Metarhizium brunneum, Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. stringae, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens) did not appear to induce strong and persistent effects on the soil microbial community [160], [161], [162]. Still the potential of a microbial pesticide to adversely affect the soil microbiota should be determined at the strain level taking into consideration its capacity to produce bioactive metabolites [163] or its cargo of transferable antibiotic resistance genes [164]. Such information could be initially deduced by the genomic data of the microbial strain and further verified experimentally.

The dsRNA-based pesticides have not reached the market yet, but they are expected to become available in the forthcoming years. Although studies regarding their efficacy [165], mode of application [166], persistence [167] and toxicity on non-target organisms [168] are available, we still have no idea about their potential effects on the soil microbiota. The highly specific mode of action of the RNAi mechanism on target mRNA suggests limited off-target toxicity effects. Bioinformatic analysis focusing on the design of dsRNA molecules with minimum homology to mRNA of non-target organisms, coupled with biological experimentation starting with phylogenetically close organisms should be considered in the assessment of the soil microbial ecotoxicity of dsRNA pesticides [169]. However, differences in the RNAi machinery of different organisms and variable uptake and internal distribution of dsRNA in different organisms are factors that might strongly influence the efficiency but also the ecotoxicity of ds-RNA pesticides [170], including effects on the soil microbiota.

According to the registration framework in Europe, low-risk pesticides undergo the same registration process as synthetic pesticides. We argue that the risk assessment procedure for the different types of low-risk pesticides should be adjusted to account for the characteristics, properties and needs of these products. This should certainly include the implementation of tools for monitoring the environmental fate and persistence of low-risk pesticides in soil.

4.2 Nano-pesticides
Nano-pesticides are plant protection products which are composed of nanoparticles, particulate substances which have one dimension less than 100 nm, that are used to increase the efficacy and reduce the environmental footprint of pesticide active ingredients [171]. They could be classified into two broad categories: (i) organic pesticide active ingredients that are complexed onto nanocarriers (soft nanoparticles like polymers, solid lipid or hard nanoparticles like silica or carbon nanotubes), (ii) inorganic active ingredients without a nanocarrier that are used directly (e.g. CuO, Cu(OH)2) [172, 173].

Nano-pesticides of the first group (organic pesticides complexed onto nanocarriers) show increasing efficacy (by 10 to 20 %), and persistence, whereas we know very little about their ecotoxicity compared to their corresponding conventional formulation and the pure active ingredients. For now, there are only a few studies looking at the off-target toxicity, including the soil microbiota, of organic nano-pesticides, their conventional formulations and the active ingredients. For example, Maruyama et al. [174] assessed the impact of the herbicides imazapic (rac-2-[4-methyl‐5-oxo‐4-(propan‐2-yl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl]-5-methylpyridine-3-carboxylic acid) and imazapyr (rac-2‐[4-methyl‐5‐oxo-4-(propan-2-yl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl] pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) encapsulated in alginate/chitosan and chitosan/tripolyphosphate nanoparticles on soil microorganisms involved in nitrogen cycling, but they did not include in their study any conventional formulation of the two herbicides. They found that encapsulated herbicides were less toxic compared to the non-encapsulated compounds.

Regarding nano-pesticides of the second group (inorganic active ingredients without a nanocarrier), we have got several studies that have investigated their effects on the soil microbiota. In a few studies, the authors examined the toxicity of nano-pesticide formulations comparatively to the inorganic active ingredient to be able to distinguish the contribution of the two components, inorganics or nanocarriers, in the toxicity observed [175, 176]. In the most comprehensive of these studies, Swart et al. [175] analyzed separately the effects of the formulated silver and CuO nanoparticles, their ionic counterparts CuCl2 and AgNO3, and their inert carriers on the soil microbiota at different concentration levels. They noted a dose-dependent effect on the soil bacterial community by the formulated products and their ionic controls but not by the nanocarriers, suggesting that the inorganics are the main drivers of the effects on soil microbiota. In support of this, Zheng et al. [177] demonstrated, via in vitro testing, that the toxic effect of silver nanoparticles on Paracoccus denitrificans, a model denitrifying bacterium, was mostly driven by silver ions decreasing the expression of denitrification and glucose assimilation enzymes and increasing polyhydroxybutyrate biosynthesis. Several other studies have reported the effects of inorganic nano-pesticides on the soil microbiota with the measured endpoints varying. Sillen et al. [178] studied the impact of silver nanoparticles on the activity of the rhizosphere microbiota via transcriptomic analysis. They noted an increased transcription of genes involved in copper resistance (e.g. efflux pumps of Ag/Cu) and a decreased transcription of ammonia monooxygenase and urease of AOA but not of AOB. In a similar study, Simonin et al. [179] showed that Cu(OH)2 nano-pesticides, applied to soil under three different fertilization regimes (ambient, low, high), did not induce any significant effect on AMF and nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Similarly, Xu et al. [180] tested the effects of TiO2 and CuO nano-pesticides on the soil microbiota and showed that the latter exhibited higher toxicity, as denoted by the significant reduction of microbial biomass carbon, total PLFAs, urease, phosphatase and dehydrogenase activity.

Overall, the small size and high surface/volume ratio of nano-pesticides coupled with the high toxicity of their inorganic active ingredients, favor their strong interaction with soil microorganisms and increase the possibility of effects on the soil microbiota. Future studies should focus on the assessment of the effects of organic nano-pesticides on the soil microbiota, comparatively to their conventional formulation and active ingredients.

4.3 Pesticide mixtures (and co-formulants)
Formulated pesticides are composed of the active ingredients and several other co-formulants that aim to maximize active ingredients efficiency on the target. The identity of these co-formulants in pesticide commercial formulations is not disclosed due to intellectual property rights. However, they could be responsible for or enhance the toxicity (e.g. by increasing the soil bioavailability) of pesticide compounds on soil microorganisms. Ecotoxicological studies exploring the toxicity of active ingredients and the corresponding commercial formulation should be employed to distinguish the contribution of the different components of pesticide formulations on the soil microbial toxicity. In such a study, Crouzet et al. [136] showed that the commercial formulation of the herbicide mesotrione, when applied at 10 times the recommended dose, induced stronger effects on the structure of the soil cyanobacteria community compared to the same levels of the pure pesticide compound. In a similar study, Rousidou et al. [101] showed that co-formulants of the formulation of the bionematicide BIOACT® (glucose or skimmed milk), which contains spores of the nematode parasitic fungus P. lilacinus, were responsible for the transient inhibition of AOM upon soil application of BIOACT®.

Besides additives, several of the commercial pesticide formulations contain more than a single active substance [181], hence releasing mixtures of pesticides in the environment. This might trigger effects deviating from those seen when applied individually. To date, most studies available on the toxicity of pesticide mixtures have focused on aquatic toxicity endpoints [182]. They suggested that, for mixtures composed of active ingredients with the same or different mode of action, the concentration addition (CA) or the independent action (IA) models, respectively, could predict toxicity [183]. On the other hand, we still know little about the potential toxicity of pesticide mixtures on soil biota and microbiota. Evaluating the applicability of CA and IA models for assessing the toxicity of pesticides on the soil microbiota or designing new models, more relevant for soil ecosystems, could be a new frontier in pesticide soil microbial ecotoxicology.

4.4 Transformation products (TPs)
Environmental risk assessment should go beyond parent compounds and address also the potential toxicity of pertinent pesticide TPs. In a benchmarking study, Sinclair and Boxall et al. [184] explored via meta-analysis the toxicity of 89 transformation products (TPs) obtained from 37 parent compounds. They showed that 70 % of the pesticide TPs have either similar or lower toxicity to aquatic organisms compared to their parent compounds. The remaining 30 % of the TPs tested were more toxic than the parent compound. This list included TPs that (i) carried the pesticide toxicophore moiety (i.e. oxime carbamate compounds) (ii) were the active compounds formed from a pro-pesticide (i.e. organophosphate compounds) or (iii) had a more potent mode of action compared to the parent compound (i.e. carbamate and organotic compounds). The EU regulatory framework still uses an exposure-driven assessment approach whereby TPs that are formed at levels exceeding 10 % of the applied parent compound are considered as relevant for environmental risk assessment [185]. This approach has often been criticized as it excludes from risk assessment a large number of TPs formed at lower amounts than the cutoff value of 10 %: the rational for defining a relevant TP should rather be based on their toxicophore moieties or mode of action [186, 187]. A reflection of these decisions was the late (20 or 30 years after their market introduction) identification of toxicologically relevant TPs like the carcinogenic N-nitroso-dimethylamine (N,N-dimethylnitrous amide), a TP of the fungicide tolylfluanid (N-[dichloro(fluoro)methanesulfanyl]‐Nʹ,Nʹ-dimethyl-N-(4-methylphenyl)sulfuric diamide) [188]. The pitfalls of this exposure-driven a priori toxicological characterization of pesticide TPs were highlighted by Storck et al. [189] who proposed the implementation of a posteriori characterization of the toxicological relevance of TPs.

To date, there are several examples in the literature where TPs rather than the parent compounds are incriminated for toxicity on the soil microbiota. Papadopoulou et al. [42] identified quinone imine, a TP of the fruit preservative ethoxyquin, as the main driver of the significant reduction in the abundance and diversity of AOM in soils treated with ethoxyquin. More recently Vasileiadis et al. [31] showed that 3,5-dichloroaniline, a major TP of iprodione, was responsible for the strong inhibition in the abundance and activity of AOM in soils treated with iprodione. In both these studies the toxicity of TPs was tested at levels relevant to their rate of formation by the parent compound, an issue that should be always considered in relevant soil studies. One of the better illustrated examples of toxicity of pesticide TPs comes from chlorothalonil. Using a conservative exposure scenario, the repeated application (4 times) of chlorothalonil in soil at dose rates 5 times the recommended led to the production of levels of 2,4,5-trichloro-6-hydroxybenzene-1,3-dicarbonitrile which induced strong inhibitory effects on the soil microbiota [190, 191].

In silico screening of the potential toxicity of pesticides on the soil microbiota could be an invaluable tool for avoiding the market introduction of compounds whose application could lead to devastating effects on the soil microbiota. A database and prediction tool for the biotransformation of organic contaminants (EnviPath) [192], has been updated with all freely accessible EU regulatory data on pesticide degradation in lab soil studies with the aim to develop more accurate prediction for pesticide biotransformation pathways [193]. Complementary tools (i.e., QSAR) enabling the prediction of the soil microbial toxicity of TPs, such as TyPoL, could allow for a targeted investigation of the TPs toxicity. Further validation of these in silico prediction tools with in vitro and in soil experimental data will enable their use in the prediction of soil microbial ecotoxicity of pesticides in the frame of environmental risk assessment.

4.5 Diversity analysis
The introduction of amplicon sequencing approaches has revolutionized our view of microbial diversity across all environmental compartments [194], including soil, which is considered the most complex environmental matrix [195]. Amplicon sequencing could monitor, at high resolution level, the composition of bacterial, archaeal, fungal and eukaryotic soil communities [196]. In addition, specific protocols allow the analysis of the diversity of key functional microbial groups like AOA, AOB [31, 197], and AMF [198], although the depth and quality of the analysis of the functional microbial diversity could be compromised by the lack of high quality or updated databases (i.e. Abell et al. [87], for AOB). Sequencing data generation is followed by in silico analysis relying on online databases (Silva, UNITE, etc.) and the use of freeware bioinformatic tools. As all DNA-based PCR methods, amplicon sequencing analysis could be affected by the presence of relic DNA from dead soil microorganisms complicating the interpretation of the data [199]. DNA relics can be removed from soil samples through treatment with DNAses [200]. Alternatively, soil RNA (and thereof cDNA) being unstable and leaving no relics upon cell lysis, could be used as a target matrix for amplicon sequencing providing insights into the active fraction of the soil microbiome [201].

The different steps of the process (PCR amplification, Sequencing, Bioinformatic Analysis) show variable levels of standardization with PCR amplification steps being more standardized than data analysis, where several issues remain open [202]. The Earth Microbiome Project, a concerted action started in 2010 [203], provided standardized amplicon sequencing protocols for studying soil microbial diversity using validated barcoded primer sets and thermocycling conditions for the amplification of the 16S rRNA gene of bacteria and archaea [204], the ITS region of fungi [205] and the 18S rRNA gene of soil eukaryotes [206] (more details available at https://earthmicrobiome.org/). These protocols have been acknowledged by the scientific community and peers which encourage all groups working on soil microbiomes to utilize the Earth Microbiome Project protocols in relevant studies to ensure comparability and high quality of the data produced [207].

The analysis of amplicon sequencing data involves several steps like: (i) merging of amplicons, removal of primers and barcodes, quality control (ii) development of the data matrix by clustering into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) or using Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) (iii) production of the taxonomic table which will be used for further analysis [208]. In all these steps decisions made and parameters selected are known to strongly affect the outcome of the analysis. For example, the use of ASVs instead of OTUs have often a marked effect on the output of community diversity analysis, with the ASV method outperforming the OTU method when the sequencing depth is adequate [202]. The latter reflects the sequencing effort efficiency to capture the existing microbial diversity and could be determined via rarefaction analysis [209]. In a first effort to contribute to a standardized platform of analysis, the Earth Microbiome Project has proposed QIIME as a tool for bioinformatic processing of the sequencing data [210], while other software like DADA2 [211], and USEARCH [212] could be used for the same purpose. It is beyond the purpose of this paper to provide a detailed technical guide on amplicon sequencing data analysis. The readers could refer to excellent reviews [213], [214], [215], [216] and new perspectives in this topic [217]. Overall, the lack of standardization in amplicon sequencing data processing and analysis hampers their use in a regulatory context. We believe that the on-going effort by the scientific community to set such standards will pave the way for their inclusion in the regulatory scheme in a near future.

Today, several studies have used amplicon sequencing to study the effects of pesticides on the soil microbial diversity [31, 57, 110, 218]. Most of these studies were aligned with the amplicon sequencing protocols of the Earth Microbiome Project, enabling the meta-analysis of the global dataset. In this context, Rocca et al. [219] presented a first meta-analysis platform called the Microbiome Stress Project, which was based on amplicon sequencing datasets obtained from experiments looking on the effects of a range of stressors on microbial diversity. This platform could be used as a base for a future systematic meta-analysis of the effects of pesticides on the soil microbiota.

Besides the lack of standardization, soil microbial ecotoxicology lacks a conceptual framework on how to translate the enormous volume of information generated by amplicon sequencing to a realistic toxicity assessment for soil microorganisms. It is now rather well-documented that, despite functional redundancy, soil microbial diversity losses often lead to reciprocal negative effects on soil microbial functioning [150, 220]. However, we still need to define the normal operating range for the different microbial endpoints as determined by amplicon sequencing. This will enable us to establish threshold values beyond which observed microbial diversity losses will have critical ecotoxicological effects. For example, we still have no answer to the question “What is the level of soil microbial diversity reduction that we could consider as imposing no unacceptable risk for the soil microbiota?”. Aquatic ecotoxicologists have identified Hazard Concentration 5 % (HC5) as a threshold value for environmental concentrations of pesticides at which, if exceeded, an unacceptable risk to the aquatic biota occurs [221]. Forthcoming research efforts should define normal operating range values per microbial endpoint that can be used by soil microbial ecotoxicologists to define relevant environmental thresholds that will preserve soil microbial di"
,,"The concept of SSDs was only recently employed to assess the toxicity of nano-pesticides on the soil microbial community. Hund-Rinke et al. [102] determined the effects of silver nanoparticles applied at five dose rates on the soil bacterial community using amplicon sequencing. They calculated EC50 values for different bacterial orders and verified the sensitivity of Nitrosomonadales to silver nanoparticles, as derived from potential ammonia oxidation studies. More recently, Swart et al. [175] tested the toxicity of silver and copper nanoparticles on the soil and gut microbiota of earthworms. Based on bacterial amplicon sequencing data, they calculated ASV specific EC50 values which were then used for the construction of SSDs and the calculation of HC5, which indicated high risk for the soil microbiota by CuO nanoparticles.

The use of SSDs but also PRCs could make feasible the implementation of amplicon sequencing data in pesticide risk assessment. Alternatively, SSDs derived from (i) meta-analysis of already available amplicon sequencing datasets from studies that meet certain experimental criteria of quality and (ii) novel soil microcosm studies (including control and at least four dose rates) testing the toxicity of a range of pesticides on soil microorganisms using amplicon sequencing measurements, could be used to identify responsive and sensitive microbial groups. These could be further promoted as microbial indicators in soil microbial ecotoxicity testing.

5.2 Ecosystem level assessment
Most soil studies to date have assessed the toxicity of pesticides on individual taxa or functional groups separately [62] or in the context of a biochemical pathway (e.g. denitrification), ignoring the ecological dimension of the effects observed [106]. In nature, microorganisms are assembled into complex and diverse communities where subpopulations are intertwined by metabolic links or other types of interactions [227], potentially important for ecosystem functioning. The resilience and robustness of microbial consortia to external perturbations has been attributed either to microbial diversity, which enables tolerant members to fill functional voids left by intolerant species [228], or to functional complementarity of network members, resulting in better exploitation of resources and elevated resistance to stress [229]. Ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms and NOB constitute one of the most well studied functional microbial networks whereby the nitrite produced by AOM through ammonia oxidation is used as a substrate by NOB to produce nitrate [83]. Recent studies suggested that the interactions between AOM and NOB could be even more complex where the latter hydrolyze urea to NH3, which is then taken up by urease-negative AOB that, in turn, produce the NO2 that is consumed by NOB [230]. These functional microbial networks operating within nitrogen cycling could be the focus of future research on the effects of pesticides. This is possible due to (i) our deep knowledge of the physiology, diversity and functioning of the microbial groups participating in these networks, (ii) the availability of relevant monitoring methods and (iii) the tight association of microbial groups participating in the different steps of the process. Studies exploring the potential resistance and resilience of such microbial networks to pesticide exposure will provide an ecosystem level look at the impact of pesticides on soil microbial functioning.

Microorganisms also interact with other organisms within the soil-food web. Predator–prey relations are particularly important for soil ecosystem functioning with protists-bacteria being the best studied model [231]. Predation by protists influences bacterial diversity and productivity with consequences on the flux of organic nutrients into biomass at higher trophic levels [232]. The diversity of both protists and bacteria interactively determines the performance of the predator [233]. External perturbations (i.e. pesticides) could affect diversity at both trophic levels with possible effects on ecosystem functioning [234], an aspect overlooked so far in pesticide research. Considering the power and the resolution of amplicon sequencing tools, we posit that soil studies should study bacterial, fungal and protistan communities and identify, via appropriate co-occurrence network analysis, pesticide-driven interactions between protists and bacteria/fungi.

Synthetic microbial communities are currently at the forefront of microbial ecology and biotechnology with applications in the biosynthesis of molecules of industrial interest or in the biodegradation of pollutants [235]. Recently, Karkaria et al. [236] proposed the use of computational methods for building stable synthetic microbial communities. The concept of synthetic microbial communities could be used to study the effects of pesticides on nitrifying microbial networks composed of ureolytic bacteria, AOB, AOA and NOB [237]. Multitrophic synthetic microbial communities composed of microorganisms from different trophic levels exhibiting predator–prey interdependencies could be also used in soil microbial ecotoxicology to verify pesticide-driven effects on protists and their prey (bacteria or fungi) (Fig. 4b). This approach could be utilized as a refinement option when Tier I in vitro tests suggest unacceptable risks for the soil microbiota.

5.3 Toxicity of pesticides on the soil interactome (plant microbiome and gut microbiome of terrestrial organisms)
Beyond soil, pesticides could directly or indirectly affect the composition of the microbial communities colonizing internal (endophytic) or external (epiphytic like in phyllosphere or carposphere) plant tissues composing all together the plant microbiome whose importance for agricultural production and plant communities is immense [238]. Recent evidence suggests that pesticide effects go beyond plants in agricultural systems and reach the symbiome of insects and earthworms with reciprocal implications for ecosystem functioning [239].

Pesticide applied directly on plant foliage could directly affect epiphytic microbial communities. On the other hand, pesticides applied via soil drenching, besides affecting the seed and rhizosphere microbiome, could be taken up by plants and could impose strong effects on the endophytic microbiome. Schaeffer et al. [240] showed, using amplicon sequencing, that fungicides could impose detrimental effects on yeasts inhabiting the nectar of almond trees like Metschnikowia which are important players in pollination. Katsoula et al. [58] showed that repeated applications of iprodione on the foliage and in the rhizosphere of pepper plants induced significant alterations in the epiphytic and soil microbiota and led to an adaptation of both microbial communities, rhizospheric and epiphytic, to enhanced biodegradation of iprodione. In contrast, other studies have suggested limited effects of pesticides on the epiphytic microbial communities [241, 242].

The effects of pesticides extend to the symbiome of earthworms and arthropods exposed to pesticides through soil or through feeding on plants. Recent studies investigated the effects of nano-pesticides on the gut microbiome of earthworms and showed contrasting results [175, 243]. Interestingly Swart et al. [175] reported that CuO nanoparticles negatively affected bacteria considered as common residents of the gut of earthworms like Candidatus Lumbricincola, which are expected to have serious implications for host vigor. On the other hand, the regular exposure of insects to pesticides like atrazine (6-chloro-N2-ethyl-N4-(propan-2-yl)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine), trichlorfon (dimethyl rac-2,2,2-trichloro-1-hydroxyethyl phosphonate), or fenitrothion (O,O-dimethyl O-(4-nitro-3-methylphenyl) phosphorothioate) could select in the insect symbiome for microorganisms that carry catabolic genes like atz which encode for enzyme catalyzing the degradation and detoxification of atrazine [244], [245], [246].

The soil microbiome is the main reservoir for plant and insect microbiomes [247]. Considering the effect of pesticides on the soil microbiota and the direct and indirect exposure of plants and insects to pesticides, we posit that effects of pesticides might be better examined at the ecosystem level where the microbiome of all biotic interactors will be studied in parallel.

5.4 Interactive effects of pesticides with other pollutants
Pesticides often encounter other organic pollutants in agricultural soils like veterinary drugs (antibiotics and anthelmintics), which end up in agricultural soil mainly through the application of manure from livestock units [248, 249]. Kurenbach et al. [250] first showed that treating bacterial pathogenic strains with herbicides like glyphosate ([(phosphonomethyl)amino]acetic acid) and dicamba (3,6-dichloro-2-methoxybenzoic acid) could induce a multiple antibiotic resistance phenotype associated with increasing upregulation of efflux pumps. This was further verified in soil where the application of glyphosate, glufosinate (ammonium rac-2-amino-4-[hydroxy(methylphosphonoyl)] butanoate), and dicamba increase the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes and mobile genetic elements in soil microbiomes [251]. These findings suggest that the application of herbicides in agricultural soils might exert a selection pressure favoring the co-selection of antibiotic resistance thereby contributing to the global antimicrobial resistance problem. However, the full extent of this phenomenon at microbiome level is not known (i.e. this is common among all pesticide groups), while the combined effects of veterinary drugs and pesticides, beyond antibiotic resistance gene dispersal, should be investigated in an ecotoxicological context.

Another group of emerging pollutants in agricultural soils are microplastics. They are plastic fragments of size smaller than 5 μm formed by the disintegration of plastic fragments released in soils and their levels in certain agricultural soils could reach up to 6.7 % [252]. A few studies in recent years have highlighted the potential adverse effects of microplastics on the soil microbiota [253, 254]. Microplastics are known to interact with pesticides in agricultural soils offering sites for their adsorption [255, 256]. Although this might suggest that microplastics might act as sinks for pesticides limiting their bioavailability and hence reducing their adverse effects on the soil microbiota, we still lack data to support this hypothesis.

Another aspect which was only recently acknowledged is the ecological role of plastisphere, the interface between soil and plastic surfaces. The composition of the microbial communities colonizing the plastisphere is only just starting to be explored compared to aquatic ecosystems [257]. Recently, Zhu et al. [258] showed that the plastisphere selects for microbial communities that are involved in diverse metabolic pathways including an enrichment in antibiotic resistance genes and bacterial pathogens compared to the surrounding soil. In this framework, the adsorption of pesticides on microplastic surfaces could favor the selection of microorganisms with tolerance or increased biodegradation capacities against pesticides. Studies trying to explore these interactions will strongly promote our knowledge on the interactive effects of pesticides with microplastics on the soil microbiota and will explore microbial evolutionary aspects that have not yet been investigated before.

5.5 Beyond amplicon sequencing: looking at pesticide effects using shotgun meta-omic approaches
Amplicon sequencing analysis could provide insights into the phylogenetic identity of the soil microbial responders to pesticides, but it falls short in providing solid functional assignments to the members of soil microbial communities. Such information could be derived through the application of shotgun meta-genomic and meta-transcriptomic approaches. To date the application of these meta-omic tools in soil microbial ecotoxicology is rare. Wu et al. [259] used a combination of amplicon sequencing and shotgun meta-genomics to look at the effects of thiamethoxam ((EZ)-{3-[(2-chloro-1,3-thiazol-5-yl)methyl]-5-methyl-1,3,5-oxadiazinan-4-ylidene}nitramide) on the soil microbiota. Beyond effects on bacterial diversity and abundance which were temporal and recovery was observed, they noted negative effects of thiamethoxam on (i) the relative abundance of nitrogen cycling genes (ii) Carbon metabolism genes involved in glycolysis, and Krebs cycle (iii) genes involved in signal regulating pathways like ABC transporters. The use of shotgun meta-genomic and meta-transcriptomic analysis in soil microbial ecotoxicology would go beyond descriptive phylogenetic information on pesticide microbial responders and look at effects at the metabolic potential and functional level while at the same time acquiring strong phylogenetic signals.

6 Conclusions
The effects of pesticides on soil microorganisms have been long overlooked at the regulatory level, despite the pivotal role of microorganisms in soil ecosystem functioning. We posit that the time is right for advancing pesticide risk assessment on soil microorganisms. This should be based on a revised tiered risk assessment scheme characterized by (i) analytical tiers with increasing level of microbial complexity (from single microorganisms at in vitro to natural microbial assemblages in soil), (ii) the use of currently available standardized methods, as a start to this revision effort (iii) defined functional microbial groups as key indicators of the soil microbial toxicity of pesticides. Such microbial indicators have been already identified and their relevance in pesticide soil microbial ecotoxicology could be further validated in studies looking at their comparative response under the same pesticide exposure scenarios. Ongoing standardization of amplicon sequencing approaches along with the implementation of advanced ecotoxicological analytical tools (e.g. SSDs, PRCs), synthetic microbial ecology approaches (synthetic microbial communities) and meta-analysis of the currently available and continuously produced amplicon sequencing data will provide the needed data for defining the normal operating range, threshold values for these microbial endpoints and identify or verify potential microbial indicator groups, all considered as essential elements of an advanced assessment of the potential risk of pesticides for the soil microbiota. The further upsurge of meta-omic tools in soil microbial ecology will shed light into the mechanisms of toxicity of pesticides on soil microorganisms and will eventually shift the focus to an ecosystem level assessment of the soil microbial toxicity of pesticides.

,,"Abstract
Models used to assess leaching risks generally use organic carbon partition coefficient (kOC) values derived from batch experiments on topsoil samples to estimate pesticide sorption in subsoils of much smaller organic carbon contents. This can introduce significant errors in leaching risk calculations, because inorganic sorbents can play an important role for sorption in subsoil. The objectives of the present study were therefore to summarize the available literature data on pesticide sorption in subsoils and to test whether a simple alternative model could improve on the standard kOC approach used in risk assessment models for pesticide leaching. This model describes the sorption constant as a power law function of the organic carbon content. A database with the results of batch sorption experiments was collated from published studies that emphasized measurements in subsoils. This database contains 1029 data entries from 36 published studies with data for 29 active substances (11 nonionic compounds, 10 weak acids, 6 weak bases, one cation, and one zwitterion). The results show that whereas the constant kOC model proved to be an adequate model for 17 of the 63 individual datasets, the power law model gave acceptable fits (p < 0.05) for 60 of these cases. The exponent in the power law model varied over a wide range, from slightly negative to near unity. It also differed significantly (p = 0.015) for ionized and nonionized compounds, with median values of 0.25 and 0.55, respectively. It is concluded that the power law model could be used to parameterize subsoil sorption in regulatory leaching models, because it has widespread applicability and is simple enough for this purpose. Suitable ways of incorporating this approach in risk assessment procedures are discussed. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:755–761. © 2017 SETAC

INTRODUCTION
Regulatory models used to assess the leaching of pesticides to groundwater still rely on the organic carbon partition coefficient (kOC) value to estimate sorption retardation. This simple approach, which assumes that pesticides sorb only to organic matter in soil, suffers from some well-known limitations 1-3. First, sorption is affected by variations in the chemical composition of soil organic matter, which leads to significant variations in apparent kOC values 4-8. Second, various inorganic constituents in soil often significantly contribute to sorption, especially for ionizable pesticides 9. For example, for weak acids, the anionic species that predominates at soil pH values larger than the pKa value may adsorb strongly to iron and aluminum oxides 10, 11. Cationic compounds as well as weak bases, which protonate at low pH values, adsorb strongly to negatively charged clay minerals in soil 12, 13. In soils of low organic matter content, sorption to soil clay minerals is not negligible even for neutral compounds 14-17. Compared with topsoil, organic matter contents in subsoil are often much smaller, and apparent kOC values are therefore much larger, because of the significant contributions of inorganic constituents to sorption 11, 18. In regulatory modeling of leaching risks to groundwater, sorption constants in subsoil are usually calculated from kOC values determined on topsoil samples. This may introduce significant systematic bias into model predictions 14, 18, 19, because the sorption constant is one of the most sensitive parameters in any pesticide leaching model 20, 21. Thus modeling approaches that improve on the kOC concept are urgently required for pesticide risk assessment and management purposes 3.

The limitations of the kOC concept outlined above have long been known. Nevertheless, kOC values are still widely used in regulatory modeling, probably because no one has yet demonstrated the general applicability of alternative approaches that are simple enough to parameterize for this purpose. The objectives of the present study are therefore to 1) make use of the available literature data to summarize and contrast the magnitude of systematic increases of apparent kOC values in subsoils for both ionizable and neutral compounds; and 2) to assess whether a simple empirical model that describes sorption as a power law function of organic carbon content might prove a suitable approach for regulatory modeling of pesticide leaching risks for both types of compounds. A comparative test of the power law model against the standard kOC approach was performed using batch data collated from 36 published studies that placed particular emphasis on measuring sorption in subsoil."
,,"For all but one of those 17 cases for which the standard kOC model was found to be acceptable using Equation 2, significant m values (at p < 0.05) could still be derived by fitting Equation 1 (Table 2). Thus, the power law model could give acceptable fits to 60 (at p < 0.05) or 62 (at p < 0.1) of the 63 datasets, with a median R2 value of 0.83. The reason for the failure of the model to fit the data from study number 25 (Table 2) may be the small number of data points (n = 6) and the very weak sorption of saflufenacil. (A kOC value of 3.6 L kg−1 can be derived for this dataset assuming a constant value.)

Table 2 and Figure 4 show that the derived m values varied over a wide range, from near unity (and in a few cases even larger than unity) to zero or in some cases even smaller. For example, the values of m derived for the zwitterion glyphosate from 3 independent studies (numbers 12, 16, and 29) were slightly negative, as they also were for the cation chlormequat (study 19; Table 2). This implies that increases in soil organic carbon content result in no net change in sorption or even a slight decrease. In other words, the more strongly adsorbing inorganic constituents, presumably clay minerals in the case of chlormequat and both clay and/or iron and aluminum oxides for glyphosate, become masked by the less adsorptive organic matter. Conversely, the occasional values of m that are significantly larger than 1 (e.g., for study number 22; Table 2) might arise because more reactive organic matter is masked by inorganic constituents in the soil that are comparatively inert for the compound 25. The extent to which the value of m may vary for any one compound is not clear, because the amount of data is rather limited. However, some significant variation should be expected, because the value of m should depend on the quantity and reactivity of inorganic constituents in the soil 18, which will vary among sites. For the 2 commonest substances found in the database (atrazine and alachlor; with 16 and 6 individual datasets, respectively), the coefficients of variation (CVs) of m were 53 and 38% for mean values of 0.67 and 0.54, respectively. For atrazine, the derived m values were rather uniformly distributed around this mean value, from values near zero to near unity or slightly larger (Table 2). In a study of atrazine sorption in 109 soil horizons in Spain, a value of m of 0.75 was determined 23 that is rather similar to the mean value estimated here. The values of kOC(ref) derived for individual compounds can also show large variations. For example, the CVs of kOC(ref) for both atrazine and alachlor are approximately 80% for mean values of 224 and 275 L kg−1, respectively, which is of a similar order of magnitude to the variation in kOC values typically reported 1. This variation is presumably because of differences in the experimental procedures adopted in the various studies 1 as well as variations in the chemical composition of organic matter among the investigated soils.

Box and whisker plot of values of the exponent m in Equations 1 and 2 for ionized and nonionized compounds. The horizontal lines indicate medians, the length of the box shows the interquartile range, and the whiskers indicate the range of typical values. Whiskers end at the value of an actual data point and cannot be longer than 1.5 times the size of the box.
Figure 4 shows that m values tend to be smaller for ionized compounds than nonionized compounds. One-way analysis of variance showed that the means of the 2 groups were significantly different at p = 0.015. This implies that sorption to inorganic surfaces is more important for weak acids, cations, and the zwitterion glyphosate than for the nonionized compounds. Median m values for ionized and nonionized compounds were 0.25 and 0.55. Thus kOC(app) typically increases by a factor of approximately 5 to 6 and 2 to 3 for ionized and nonionized compounds, respectively, as the organic carbon content decreases by a factor of 10.

DISCUSSION
The present study confirms, if confirmation were needed, that significant increases in (apparent) kOC values in subsoil horizons of low organic matter content are widespread. Following the precautionary principle, it could be argued that it is acceptable to ignore this phenomenon in risk assessments for groundwater protection. However, legal considerations within the European Union (e.g., regulation EC 1107/2009) also require that pesticide risk assessments should be based on current scientific knowledge and should account for all relevant processes. The unresolved question, therefore, is how this should best be done. The situation can be considered analogous to the problem of dealing with pesticide degradation in subsoil in leaching risk assessments. It has long been known that smaller microbial populations and reduced activity generally result in decreases in degradation rates in subsoil, although the magnitude of this reduction is difficult to predict for specific compounds in specific soils. The issue was resolved in the European Union FOCUS procedures by using agreed-on generic reduction factors applied to the degradation rate constants measured in topsoil samples 26. A similar approach is proposed in the present study for sorption, making use of the power law model to estimate subsoil sorption as a complement to the standard kOC approach for topsoil. For this purpose, Equation 2 would be applied, taking the reported kOC value in the regulatory dossier as kOC(ref) for the compound, the average organic carbon content for the investigated soils as fOC(ref), and the median values of m for nonionized and ionized compounds (0.25 and 0.55, respectively). An alternative approach for first-tier risk assessments would be to follow the precautionary principle by defining a ”reasonable worst-case” value of m. For example, in current European Union procedures, first-tier model simulations ignore sorption kinetics as well as increases in sorption at low pH values for ionizable compounds. Thus, following the same philosophy, generic high-percentile values of m in Equation 2 could be chosen to support lower tier modeling. For example, 70th percentile values of m for nonionized and ionized compounds are 0.43 and 0.86. More data on pesticide sorption in subsoil would be needed to define even higher percentile values, because the current dataset is still relatively small.

For higher tier modeling, compound-specific approaches could be envisaged based on empirical pedotransfer functions or extended partitioning models that account for sorption to the different phases in soil (e.g., organic matter, clay minerals, iron and aluminum oxides) and, where relevant, the effects of soil pH 11, 13, 17, 18, 24, 27, 28. However, it should be emphasized that such models developed on data obtained for topsoil samples may not give reliable predictions in subsoils. In this respect, it is probably true to say that the data currently available on sorption in subsoils are insufficient to develop reliable compound-specific equations for all but a small number of very widely studied compounds.

CONCLUSIONS
Parameterizing subsoil sorption in leaching models using kOC values derived from topsoil samples will lead to significant error in many cases. For leaching risk assessments, this approach could be replaced by the power law model tested in the present study, because it appears to have widespread applicability and is also simple enough to parameterize for this purpose.

,,"Abstract
A method based on Hasse diagram is adopted to detect priority pesticides among the 130 most used in Europe. Hasse diagrams rank pesticides in groups of potential hazard to the water environment, according to pesticide properties (water solubility, vapour pressure and persistence in soil) and usages. The procedure is applied on a territorial scale, selecting Germany, U.K. and Italy as case studies, and validated with the experimental results of monitoring programs. Most of the pesticides ranked as a first priority by the model and analyzed for in water were effectively found. The percentage of positive findings decreases from class 1 to 6 of priority in agreement with the theoretical predictions. The model suggests that each country must develop its own analytical protocol addressed to the detection of the most “probable” pesticides. Pesticide metabolities of Italian priority pesticides are appraised in detail and their risk is assessed according to their occurrence in surface and groundwater, persistence estimated from field data and ecotoxicity data. The proposed procedure can steer research efforts towards compounds that really represent a risk for human health and aquatic life."

Background
We evaluated the relationship between diagnosed depression and pesticide exposure using information from private pesticide applicators enrolled in the Agricultural Health Study between 1993 and 1997 in Iowa and North Carolina.
Methods
There were 534 cases who self-reported a physician-diagnosed depression and 17,051 controls who reported never having been diagnosed with depression and did not feel depressed more than once a week in the past year. Lifetime pesticide exposure was categorized in three mutually exclusive groups: low (< 226 days, the reference group), intermediate (226–752 days), and high (> 752 days). Two additional measures represented acute high-intensity pesticide exposures: an unusually high pesticide exposure event (HPEE) and physician-diagnosed pesticide poisoning. Logistic regression analyses were performed relating pesticide exposure to depression.
Results
After adjusting for state, age, education, marital status, doctor visits, alcohol use, smoking, solvent exposure, not currently having crops or animals, and ever working a job off the farm, pesticide poisoning was more strongly associated with depression [odds ratio (OR) = 2.57; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.74–3.79] than intermediate (OR = 1.07; 95% CI, 0.87–1.31) or high (OR = 1.11; 95% CI, 0.87–1.42) cumulative exposure or an HPEE (OR = 1.65; 95% CI, 1.33–2.05). In analysis of a subgroup without a history of acute poisoning, high cumulative exposure was significantly associated with depression (OR = 1.54; 95% CI, 1.16–2.04).
Conclusion
These findings suggest that both acute high-intensity and cumulative pesticide exposure may contribute to depression in pesticide applicators. Our study is unique in reporting that depression is also associated with chronic pesticide exposure in the absence of a physician-diagnosed poisoning.
Recent reviews have noted neurologic sequelae of pesticide exposure among farmers (Jamal et al. 2002a; Kamel and Hoppin 2004), and in the past decade strong associations have been reported between high-level occupational exposure to pesticides and an increased risk of depression (Amr et al. 1997; Farahat et al. 2003; Stephens et al. 1995). In an Egyptian population, the frequency of depressive neurosis was significantly higher in male pesticide formulators with at least 15 years of pesticide exposure compared with matched controls (Amr et al. 1997). In the same study, severe depression scores from the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) were significantly higher in male pesticide applicators than in their non-exposed controls matched on age, socioeconomic status, and educational levels. The exposures considered were primarily carbamates, pyrethroids, and organophosphates (OPs) applied to cotton fields; although pesticide poisoning was not reported, the investigators noted that safety measures were poor in this study population (Amr et al. 1997). Another Egyptian study of 52 male agricultural engineers, pesticide mixers, and mechanics who worked in pesticide application showed a higher neuroticism score compared with 50 demographically similar clerks and administrators (Farahat et al. 2003). Vulnerability to psychiatric disorders, as determined by the GHQ, was found to be 50% greater in 146 OP-exposed sheep farmers compared with 143 quarry worker controls in the United Kingdom (Stephens et al. 1995). However, a study of 57 male tree-fruit farmers exposed to OPs showed no significant difference in depression rates when compared with 42 age-matched, unexposed cranberry/blueberry growers (a farming control group) or hardware store owners (Fielder et al. 1997).
A number of studies have shown long-term depression as a sequela of an acute pesticide poisoning (Beseler et al. 2006; Reidy et al. 1992; Rosenstock et al. 1991; Savage et al. 1988; Stallones and Beseler 2002). Having experienced a pesticide-related illness was significantly associated with depression measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) in 761 Colorado farm residents (Stallones and Beseler 2002). In 52 tobacco farmers in southern Brazil who were applying OPs (13 reporting a history of poisoning), the number of individuals with depression or anxiety disorders was significantly higher than expected but declined after 3 months without OP exposure (Salvi et al. 2003). The level and duration of pesticide exposure resulting in depression remain unclear. Although the above studies suggest a high-level exposure is needed, mechanisms have been proposed that could explain an association with chronic, low-dose toxicity (Brown and Brix 1998; Browne et al. 2006; Ray and Richards 2001). Anxiety and depression have been observed in the course of conducting extensive neurologic examinations but only recently have been the focus of hypothesis-driven research. For example, feeling depressed, indifferent, or withdrawn during the last 12 months, one of many self-reported neurologic symptoms examined, was associated with cumulative pesticide exposure among licensed pesticide applicators in the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) (Kamel et al. 2005).
The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between pesticide exposure and physician-diagnosed depression in a cohort of farmer applicators enrolled in the AHS.
Materials and Methods
The AHS cohort includes 89,658 individuals (4,916 commercial applicators, 52,395 private applicators, and 32,347 spouses of private applicators) who were recruited in Iowa and North Carolina from 1993 through 1997 and who are being followed to assess a variety of health outcomes (Blair et al. 2005). The present analysis was restricted to private applicators, who were primarily farmers. Commercial pesticide applicators were excluded from the study because they have patterns of exposure different from those of farmer applicators (Alavanja et al. 1999; Arbuckle et al. 2002); female spouses were considered in a previous publication (Beseler et al. 2006). The current study is a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the ongoing cohort study.
All applicators completed a questionnaire at enrollment, and 44% (22,916) completed a supplemental questionnaire at home. Together, the questionnaires provided detailed information on physician-diagnosed depression, pesticide use, and covariates, including race, ethnicity, education, marital status, medical conditions, alcohol use, and smoking habits (Alavanja et al. 1996). Copies of the questionnaires are available online (AHS 2008).
Information on physician-diagnosed depression and physician-diagnosed pesticide poisoning was requested only in the supplemental questionnaire, so we included only those applicators who completed the latter in the present analysis. Although generally similar to the entire AHS population, the non-responders, who were significantly younger than those who responded to the questionnaire, spent more time mixing and applying pesticides than the responders and had slightly greater cumulative exposure (Tarone et al. 1997). Of the 22,916 applicators who returned the supplemental questionnaire, 882 applicators with missing depression information, 96 with previous lead or solvent poisoning, 28 who were < 18 years of age including one whose age was unknown, and 556 women were excluded from the study. Lead poisoning and solvent poisoning are strongly associated with neurologic effects (Walker 2000), and depression in men is different from depression in women (Kornstein et al. 1996).
Cases were defined as farmer applicators who responded “yes” to the question, “Has a doctor ever told you that you had (been diagnosed with) depression requiring medication or shock therapy?” Those responding “yes” were asked about their age at diagnosis in four categories (< 20, 20–39, 40–59, > 59 years). Controls were farmer applicators who had not been diagnosed with depression. To reduce potential misclassification, 848 individuals who reported feeling depressed, indifferent, or withdrawn once a week or more during the year prior to enrollment, but had not been diagnosed with depression, were excluded from the control group. This left a final study population of 17,585, with 534 cases of diagnosed depression and 17,051 controls who had complete information for analyses. In a supplemental analysis, we included the 848 individuals with depressive symptoms at least once a week in the control group to determine the impact of the exclusion on our results.
Cumulative exposure to any pesticide was categorized in three groups, based on the distribution of lifetime application days. The latter were calculated as the average number of days per year the applicator mixed or applied any pesticide (asked in six categories) multiplied by the total number of years of pesticide use (asked in seven categories), using the midpoints of the categories. The low-exposure group (reference group) had used pesticides < 226 days (the median); the intermediate-exposure group reported 226–752 days of use (the median to the 90th percentile); and the high-exposure group reported > 752 days of use (≥ 90th percentile). Two additional variables, identifying applicators who had ever experienced an unusually high pesticide exposure event (HPEE) or physician-diagnosed pesticide poisoning, were created, regardless of lifetime application days of use. Those who answered “yes” to the question “Have you ever had an incident or experience while using any type of pesticide which caused you unusually high personal exposure?” were categorized as having had an HPEE. Those who answered “yes” to “Has a doctor ever told you that you had (been diagnosed with) pesticide poisoning?” were classified as having had a pesticide poisoning. These variables were not mutually exclusive, that is, those with an HPEE would also have a value for lifetime days of exposure and an indicator for the presence or absence of a history of pesticide poisoning, and those with a history of pesticide poisoning would have a value for lifetime days of exposure and an indicator for the presence or absence of an HPEE.
The questionnaires also collected detailed information on the lifetime use of 50 pesticides: 22 on the enrollment questionnaire and 28 on the supplemental questionnaire. Functional pesticide groups were created by combining data for specific chemicals, including 18 herbicides, 22 insecticides, 6 fungicides, and 4 fumigants. Three groups of insecticides were analyzed: OPs (malathion, parathion, diazinon, phorate, coumaphos, dichlorvos, chlorpyrifos, fonofos, terbufos, and trichlorfon); carbamates (carbaryl, carbofuran, and aldicarb); and organochlorines (aldrin, chlordane, dieldrin, DDT, heptachlor, and toxaphene).
We selected covariates evaluated in univariate logistic regression models based on previous studies of pesticides or depression and included age, state of residence, high school education, race (white, other), Hispanic ethnicity, marital status, smoking behavior (Breslau et al. 1998), alcohol use, frequency of visits to a doctor in the past year, farms with no crops or animals, working a job off the farm, number of years lived or worked on a farm, and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) (Scarth et al. 2000; Stallones et al. 1995). Those who were legally married or living as married were classified as married and those who were divorced, widowed, or never married were considered unmarried. Age was categorized into four levels based roughly on quartiles, because those who were younger or older were less likely to be depressed than those in the middle years. Alcohol use in the past year was categorized as never, less than one drink per week, one to four drinks per week, and daily or almost daily. We used one to four drinks per week as the reference group because individuals with this level of alcohol use had the lowest risk of depression. Those who reported never using PPE when handling pesticides were compared with those who reported using PPE. In addition, individual types of PPE were analyzed separately including fabric/leather gloves, chemically resistant gloves, face shields, respirators, and disposable clothing. Solvent information from a question asking about exposures from the nonfarm job held the longest was included in the multivariable models to adjust for the association of solvents with neurologic conditions (Walker 2000). On- and off-farm exposure to metals, such as lead solder, welding and electroplating fumes, lead, mercury, cadmium, and other metals, as well as additional exposures to gasoline and other solvents, were also evaluated as potential confounders of the relationship between pesticide exposure and physician-diagnosed depression.
We used univariate and multivariable models to evaluate associations of depression with cumulative exposure to any pesticide or with functional pesticide groups. Multivariable models were adjusted for potential confounders that were significantly associated with both depression in the univariate analyses and also associated with the three cumulative categories of exposure to any pesticide, an HPEE, or pesticide poisoning; the models excluded additional pesticide exposure variables to avoid bias due to overcontrol. Covariates included in the final models were state of residence, marital status, age, off-farm solvent exposure, alcohol use, smoking behavior, education, working a job off the farm, doctor visits, and having no crops or animals on the farm.
To separate the effects of cumulative lifetime exposure from those of high exposure, we ran three multivariable models:
•	
Model 1 included all subjects.
•	
Model 2 excluded those who reported an HPEE.
•	
Model 3 excluded those who reported a pesticide poisoning.
•	
Model 4 excluded those who reported an HPEE or a pesticide poisoning.
Although state of residence was not significant in univariate models, it was included in multivariable models to adjust for economic differences resulting from farm size, products, and differences in farming practices between states. For the entire sample, we ran a single multivariable model that included the three level cumulative exposure variable and two separate variables for HPEE and pesticide poisoning. We also conducted the same analyses separately by state of residence to determine whether associations were found in both states and to identify any differences between the states.
Results are reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). We used the 2 August 2002 release of the AHS phase I dataset (Prerelease 0208) for all analyses. This work was conducted with approval from the Institutional Review Boards of Colorado State University, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the National Cancer Institute. All study participants gave written informed consent prior to the study.
Results
In this study population, 3.0% reported a physician-diagnosed depression; prevalence was similar in North Carolina (2.8%) and Iowa (3.1%). We compared demographic characteristics between cases and controls in those with complete data for all covariates (Table 1). Race and ethnicity did not differ between cases and controls, but there were very few nonwhites or Hispanics in the study population. Cases were more likely than controls to be older, be unmarried, have more visits to the doctor, be a past smoker, consume alcohol less frequently, have ever worked off the farm, and presently live on a farm with no crops or animals, but there were no differences between cases and controls in the lifetime number of years lived or worked on a farm (Table 1). The use of PPE for pesticide application did not differ between cases and controls (Table 1). Further analysis by type of PPE, including fabric/leather work gloves, chemically resistant gloves, gas mask, face shield, and disposable clothing, showed that only wearing chemically resistant gloves was protective against being depressed (OR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64–0.97). Cases were more likely to have had exposure to solvents and heavy metals in the nonfarm job that they held the longest (Table 1). Exposures to other solvents (gasoline and cleaning solvents) from both on- and off-farm exposures were not significantly associated with depression. No significant association was observed between diagnosed depression and lifetime days of pesticide exposure in univariate analysis; however, cases were more likely to have spent a greater number of years mixing and applying pesticides. Significantly increased odds of depression were observed for individuals who reported an HPEE and those with a history of pesticide poisoning. The median lifetime days of pesticide exposure was significantly higher in both those who reported an HPEE and those who reported a history of pesticide poisoning (370 days) compared with those who did not report either of these events (225 days) (p < 0.0001). No significant interactions were observed between any of the demographic variables and any of the exposure levels."
,,"Discussion
In the present study, depression was associated with a history of pesticide poisoning or an HPEE after adjusting for important covariates. In addition, after excluding subjects with an HPEE or poisoning, high cumulative pesticide exposure was significantly associated with diagnosed depression. We observed similar results when subjects with depressive symptoms were included in the control group. These findings extend previous reports where symptoms of anxiety and depression were reported in pesticide-poisoned individuals (Reidy et al. 1992; Savage et al. 1988; Stokes et al. 1995). Acutely exposed migrant farm workers (n = 21) with documented cholinesterase inhibition reported feeling depressed and anxious significantly more often than unexposed controls (n = 11) matched on age, sex, education, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity (Reidy et al. 1992). Savage et al. (1988) and Steenland et al. (1994) found significant alterations in mood in subjects who had experienced a pesticide poisoning from 3 to > 10 years prior to evaluation. The present study is unique in reporting that depression is also associated with chronic pesticide exposure in the absence of a physician-diagnosed poisoning.
In the present study, ever having used insecticides, OPs, or organochlorines was significantly associated with diagnosed depression. Long-term exposure to DDT has been associated with an increase in psychiatric symptoms (van Wendel de Joode et al. 2001). DDT alone was not significantly associated with depression in this farming population in univariate (OR = 1.17; 95% CI, 0.96–1.42) or adjusted models (OR = 1.09; 95% CI, 0.87–1.37). Carbamates were not associated with depression, indicating that the rapid reactivation of acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) after carbamate inhibition may reduce the risk of depression, or an altogether different mechanism may explain the association of OPs and depression in previous studies and in the current one.
Genetic susceptibility may play a role in the association of depression with pesticide exposure. Those with a personal or family history of affective disorders may be at increased risk of depression when exposed to ACHE-inhibiting OPs (Janowsky et al. 1994). The increased risk in those with long-term pesticide exposure might be due to genetic vulnerability to pesticide effects resulting from a paraoxonase polymorphism (Browne et al. 2006; Cherry et al. 2002; Costa et al. 2003) or other genetic variant.
Several mechanisms have been proposed for subthreshold exposure resulting in delayed, long-term depression (Browne et al. 2006; Bryk et al. 2005; Kaufer et al. 1998; Shapira et al. 2000). Inhibition of ACHE results in neuronal hyperexcitability and increased production of an alternative ACHE mRNA product known as ACHE-R, which cannot form multimers. Increased ACHE-R causes changes in gene expression via c-fos and subsequent changes in protein expression, leading to a reduction in acetylcholine and a decrease in choline acetyltransferase and vesicular acetylcholine transporter proteins (Kaufer et al. 1998). All of these changes represent the cholinergic system trying to react to stress and trying to repair the imbalance due to over-stimulation (Kaufer et al. 1998). Although useful in the short term, over time these changes can be deleterious and may lead to psychiatric problems. Additionally, polymorphisms in the ACHE promoter may cause some individuals to be more sensitive to ACHE-inhibiting pesticides (Shapira et al. 2000), and polymorphisms in both paraoxonase and ACHE may interact to further increase susceptibility (Bryk et al. 2005).
An alternative explanation for the positive findings in the high cumulative pesticide exposure category is that applicators in this category were more likely to have had an unreported HPEE or poisoning. The reporting of lifetime pesticide use in the AHS has been evaluated and shown to be reliable (Blair et al. 2002); however, the reliability of reporting an HPEE or a pesticide poisoning is unknown. Although use of mutually exclusive categories for analysis suggests that high cumulative exposure was associated with depression independent of HPEE or poisoning, the reverse is not necessarily true. Those reporting an HPEE or poisoning were also likely to have had high cumulative exposure, and it cannot be determined which of these exposure events led to an increased risk of depression. It is possible that both contribute and that an HPEE or poisoning against a background of high cumulative exposure is associated with increased risk of depression.
Overall, the prevalence of physician-diagnosed depression (3.0%) was relatively low in this farming population compared with community surveys using the CES-D with a score of ≥16 as an indicator of clinical depression. Using the CES-D, male farm residents showed a prevalence of depression of 7.9% in Colorado (Stallones et al. 1995), 12.2% in Iowa (Scarth et al. 2000), and 20% in a farming community in Tennessee (Linn and Husaini 1987). The difference between diagnosed depression and depression determined from a survey instrument is a function of propensity to seek treatment, access to health care in the rural community, and the training of physicians to ask about depressive symptoms, as well as the actual prevalence of depression. It could be that AHS participants are not likely to seek treatment for mental health conditions, as was reported by Linn and Husaini (1987), where only 5.3% of farmers who were depressed using the CES-D sought medical treatment (Linn and Husaini 1987). Even if individuals recognize depression and seek treatment, they may not report their condition on a questionnaire. Differences among communities may also be related to a number of economic conditions, including farm size and products produced.
Those visiting a doctor at least two times during the past year showed twice the odds of being diagnosed with depression compared with those with only one visit. This agrees with a previous study showing that a greater number of visits to a doctor increased the chances of being diagnosed with depression (Bertakis et al. 2001). Conversely, those who are depressed may visit a doctor more often. To examine importance of this reciprocal relationship, we stratified the analysis by the number of doctor visits and found that although a history of pesticide poisoning was 2-fold higher in those without a doctor visit in the past year compared with those with one or more visits, pesticide poisoning was the most important predictor of depression in both strata of doctor visits. The results were only slightly greater in multivariable models that did not adjust for number of doctor visits in the past year (medium cumulative days: OR = 1.08; 95% CI, 0.88– 1.32; high cumulative days: OR = 1.15; 95% CI, 0.90–1.48; HPEE: OR = 1.81; 95% CI, 1.46–2.24; pesticide poisoning: OR = 2.73; 95% CI, 1.86–4.02). A limitation of this analysis is that doctor visits in the 12 months prior to completing the supplemental questionnaire may not represent doctor visits during the time the depression diagnosis was made. Because of the lack of adequate temporal information, it can only be concluded that the relationship between a history of pesticide poisoning and diagnosed depression was not a function of the number of doctor visits in the year preceding enrollment into the AHS.
The strengths of the present study include the large number of cases of self-reported physician-diagnosed depression, a detailed questionnaire containing information on pesticide use history and other risk factors for depression, a gradation of exposure levels, and controls drawn from the same population as cases, which minimizes potential confounding.
A limitation is that information on diagnosed depression and pesticide exposure was collected cross-sectionally, and both were self-reported. Additionally, age at diagnosis of depression and age at pesticide poisoning were asked in 20-year age categories, and no specific dates were available for either diagnosis. It is possible that depression could increase the probability of an HPEE or pesticide poisoning. However, of the 33 individuals who had both a diagnosis of pesticide poisoning and depression and provided information on the age category when these diagnoses occurred, only one individual reported depression prior to pesticide poisoning.
A further limitation is that data on some potential confounding factors, such as financial information, including income and debt, and indicators of social support, were not available. These factors could be related to stress in the AHS participants, which may increase the probability of having a pesticide poisoning and may also result in depression. It is also possible that those who did not return the supplemental questionnaire were more likely to be depressed than the 44% who did return it. This would lead to an underestimation of the effect sizes of pesticide exposure on depression, especially in those with an HPEE or pesticide poisoning, where the effects appear to be greater.
It is possible that a pesticide poisoning may not result in a diagnosis, either because treatment was not sought or because a physician did not recognize it as a pesticide poisoning. These individuals would have been misclassified with respect to diagnosed poisoning but may have reported the event as an unusually high exposure. These individuals would have fallen into the HPEE category regardless of their cumulative days of exposure. Misclassification of cumulative exposures is also possible. Repeat interviews conducted in Iowa on 4,088 applicators found a high degree of agreement in ever/never use of specific pesticides and application practices, and less agreement for duration, frequency, and decade of first pesticide use (Blair et al. 2002). However, most of the responses were within one category from the response given a year previously (Blair et al. 2002). Collapsing cumulative exposure into three levels most likely minimizes potential misclassification.
Conclusion
In this study, based on questionnaire data from a well-defined agricultural cohort, high cumulative exposure in the absence of an HPEE or pesticide poisoning, as well as a history of either HPEE or physician-diagnosed pesticide poisoning, was significantly associated with physician-diagnosed depression. The pattern was similar in separate analyses for Iowa and North Carolina.
Physicians should be alert to mood changes in those with a history of applying pesticides. A review of the literature shows that whenever neurologic effects are observed and mood is examined, they tend to be related (Farahat et al. 2003; Jamal et al. 2002b; Stephens et al. 1995). These results suggest that pesticide exposure may contribute to depression in farmer applicators and emphasize the importance of minimizing pesticide exposures. Future work on neurologic effects of pesticide exposure should include measures of affective disorders, including depression and anxiety."
,,"Abstract
Background
Sri Lanka has reduced its overall suicide rate by 70% over the last two decades through means restriction, through a series of government regulations and bans removing highly hazardous pesticides from agriculture. We aimed to identify the key pesticide(s) now responsible for suicides in rural Sri Lanka to provide data for further pesticide regulation.

Methods
We performed a secondary analysis of data collected prospectively during a cluster randomized controlled trial in the Anuradhapura district of Sri Lanka from 2011 to 16. The identity of pesticides responsible for suicides were sought from medical or judicial medical notes, coroners’ records, and the person’s family. Trend analysis was done using a regression analysis with curve estimation to identify relative importance of key pesticides.

Results
We identified 337 suicidal deaths. Among them, the majority 193 (57.3%) were due to ingestion of pesticides while 82 (24.3%) were due to hanging. A specific pesticide was identified in 105 (54.4%) of the pesticide suicides. Ingestion of carbosulfan or profenofos was responsible for 59 (56.2%) of the suicides with a known pesticide and 17.5% of all suicides. The increasing trend of suicides due to carbosulfan and profenofos over time was statistically significant (R square 0.846, F 16.541, p 0.027).

Conclusion
Ingestion of pesticides remains the most important means of suicides in rural Sri Lanka. The pesticides that were once responsible for most pesticide suicides have now been replaced by carbosulfan and profenofos. Their regulation and replacement in agriculture with less hazardous pesticides will further reduce the incidence of both pesticide and overall suicides in rural Sri Lanka.

Peer Review reports
Background
Ingestion of pesticides is one of the three most important global means of suicide [1], accounting for up to 20% of global suicides [2]. Widespread agricultural use of highly hazardous pesticides [3] (HHP) in small-scale farming in low and middle income countries (LMIC), poor home storage [4], and unrestricted over-the-counter sales [5] ensure that such pesticides are easily accessible for acts of self-poisoning. Our recent systematic review indicates that a worldwide ban on the use of HHP in agriculture is likely to be the most effective means of reducing both pesticide-specific and overall suicide rates in countries where pesticides are important means of suicide [6].

Pesticide self-poisoning was the most common means of suicide in Sri Lanka during 1976 to 2011 [7]. However, Sri Lanka has used means restriction and pesticide regulation to sequentially ban agricultural pesticides that have become popular for self-harm [8] producing one of the greatest falls in suicide ever seen [9]. Knipe and colleagues recently estimated that Sri Lanka has reduced its overall suicide rate by 70% (saving 93,000 lives) since 1995 predominantly through regulation of pesticides [10]. This was done despite being unable to comprehensively address [6] the complex psychosocial and cultural factors that may underlie suicide [1]. As a result, the WHO recently published, with the FAO, a guide for pesticide regulators on suicide prevention [11] and recently proposed that regulation of problematic highly hazardous pesticides is a highly cost-effective approach to suicide prevention [12].

However, pesticide self-poisoning is still the second most common method of suicide in Sri Lanka, causing 800 to 1000 deaths for each of the last 3 years according to official statistics [13]. Most recent data suggested that the incidence of pesticide suicide in rural Sri Lanka remains around 20/100,000 population [14] – far higher than the global incidence of suicide from all means [1] Many of these deaths occur after ingestion of pesticides classified by the WHO as being of only moderately acute toxicity [15], due to the large volumes ingested and the solvents in these agricultural formulations [16, 17].

A prospective cohort study conducted in secondary hospitals [18] (2002–2008) reported that > 78% of pesticide suicides were due to five pesticides (the organophosphorus (OP) insecticides dimethoate, fenthion, and chlorpyrifos, and the herbicides paraquat and propanil). Although the case fatality was higher for dimethoate, fenthion, and paraquat, which were responsible for most deaths, the common use of the other less hazardous pesticides (chlorpyrifos and propanil) meant that they were also responsible for many suicides [18]. In 2008, Sri Lankan regulatory authorities made a decision to remove dimethoate, fenthion, and paraquat from agriculture over 3 years to reduce suicides [19]. This was followed by withdrawal of chlorpyrifos and propanil in 2014 [20]; of note, these latter withdrawals were not focused on suicide prevention but on other potential health issues [21].

Withdrawal of one agricultural pesticide usually results in its replacement by another product targeting the same pest or weed (or of a non-chemical approach to pest control); therefore, continued monitoring is required to identify new pesticides rising in popularity for agriculture and hence suicide in a timely manner [10, 22]. Therefore, we have continued to monitor the pesticides responsible for fatal self-harm since 2011. In this work, we aimed to identify the key pesticide(s) currently responsible for pesticide suicides in rural Sri Lanka to inform decisions about the need for future pesticide regulations.

Methods
Study design
This study reports a secondary analysis of prospective suicide data collected among more than 250,000 population residing in six divisional secretariats (Thambuttegama, Thalawa, Nochchiyagama, Rajanganaya, Galnewa and Ipalogama) of south western Anuradhapura District, North Central Province of Sri Lanka (Fig. 1) as part of a cluster-randomized controlled trial [14]. The population under study varied across the study period; therefore, no estimate of incidence has been calculated from the data."
,,"Primary dataset and data collection procedure
Data used in this study were collected during post-intervention follow-up surveillance for a community-based cRCT to evaluate the effectiveness of household pesticide storage devices for reducing pesticide self-poisoning [14, 23]. Data on suicides due to pesticide poisoning was collected between July 2011 and May 2016. Data were collected from six different local sources where deaths are registered (Table 1) and cross-checked, to reduce the risk that suicides would be missed or wrongly reported during data collection period."
,,"Information on deaths occurring in primary and secondary hospitals was extracted daily from the episodic medical notes (termed bed head tickets; BHT) and/or ward death registers, whereas in tertiary hospitals information was extracted from Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) records at the end of the data collection period. Deaths that occurred before hospital presentation were identified by regular review of the records of community coroners and police. At the end of the data collection period, suspected suicide deaths and deaths with open decisions were sought by examination of records belonging to local magistrates. Finally, copies of death certificates at the divisional secretariats were manually searched to minimize the number of suicides missed in the prospective data collection.

Data were extracted from death records using a structured data collection form by trained research assistants. If necessary, additional visits were made by the research team to the dead person’s family or relatives to collect missing information.

Underlying causes of death are coded in the data according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) [24]. Suicide by pesticide poisoning was defined as those cases featuring the ICD-10 code X68 and intentional self-harm by hanging, strangulation or suffocation is X70. Among suicides due to pesticide poisoning, ICD-10 T codes were used to identify the specific category of agents including insecticides (T60.0-T60.2), herbicides and fungicides (T60.3), rodenticides and other pesticides (T60.4, T60.8) and unspecified pesticides (T60.9).

Definition of a pesticide suicide
A pesticide suicide was defined as an act of deliberately killing oneself by ingesting one or more agricultural pesticides (insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and rodenticides) with the case being confirmed and registered in one or more of the death registration sources during the study period.

Identification of ingested pesticide
For hospitalized patients, the ingested pesticide was normally reported in the BHT or JMO’s report, based on the history from patients or family, seeing the pesticide product label or bottle, and/or clinical symptoms and post-mortem examination. For non-hospitalized cases, this information was obtained from police and/or coroners’ records. If the identity of the ingested pesticide was not available in any official sources, the research team re-contacted the dead person’s family soon after the death to identify the pesticide container. If there was inconsistency of the ingested pesticide(s) between the two or more sources, the medical examination report was given priority.

Data linking
After collection of death records from sources, data were linked manually using a simple algorithm which used death persons’ demographic information (name, age, gender, address) and incident related information (date/time of incident, date/time of death, type/active ingredient of the ingested pesticide) to identify multiple records of the same event and prevent double counting. After cases were identified, they were allocated a unique case identifier.

Data analysis
We used GraphPad Prism, Quickcalcs and SPSS 25 for analyses. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the types of pesticides and types of active ingredients. Trend analysis was done using a regression analysis with curve estimation.

Results
Pesticide suicides
The data identified a total of 337 suicidal deaths. Of these cases, 193 (57.3%) and 82 (24.3%) were reported as being due to ingestion of pesticides and hanging, respectively (Fig. 2). The type of pesticide was unknown in 32/193 (16.6%) cases, the class of pesticide was unknown in 30/193 (15.5%) cases, and the particular OP insecticide was unknown in 26/193 (13.5%) cases. Where the pesticide type was known, 125/161 (77.6%) were due to insecticides, 31/161 (19.3%) due to herbicides, and 5/161 (3.1%) due to other type of pesticides. OP insecticides were responsible for 50/131 (38.2%) pesticide suicides with identified pesticides over the study period. The following analysis includes only the 105 cases for which the specific pesticide was positively identified.

,,"Common pesticides used for suicide in 2011–2016
The majority of deaths resulted from ingestion of the carbamate insecticide carbosulfan (43, 41.0%) or the OP insecticide profenofos (13, 12.4%) (Fig. 3). Carbosulfan was involved in a further three mixed pesticide self-poisoning cases (giving a total of 46 cases, 43.8%). Ingestion of carbosulfan or profenofos was directly implicated in 56.2% [59/105] pesticide suicides (and at least 17.5% [59/337] of overall suicides). Over the same period three pesticides banned in 2008 and 2014 (paraquat, chlorpyrifos and propanil) were involved in only 17% (18/105) pesticide suicides (and at least 5.3% of all means of suicides). Dimethoate and fenthion were not reported as being involved in any suicides during 2011 to 2016. There were very few cases of suicides with pesticides banned before "
,,"Abstract
Prevention and control of damage to health, crops, and property by insects, fungi, and noxious weeds are the major goals of pesticide applications. As with use of any biologically active agent, pesticides have unwanted side-effects. In this review, we will examine the thesis that adverse pesticide effects are more likely to occur in children who are at special developmental and behavioral risk. Children's exposures to pesticides in the rural and urban settings and differences in their exposure patterns are discussed. The relative frequency of pesticide poisoning in children is examined. In this connection, most reported acute pesticide poisonings occur in children younger than age 5. The possible epidemiological relationships between parental pesticide use or exposure and the risk of adverse reproductive outcomes and childhood cancer are discussed. The level of consensus among these studies is examined. Current concerns regarding neurobehavioral toxicity and endocrine disruption in juxtaposition to the relative paucity of toxicant mechanism-based studies of children are explored.

,,"Abstract
After a pest develops resistance to a pesticide, switching between different unrelated pesticides is a common management option, but this raises the following questions: (1) What is the optimal frequency of pesticide use? (2) How do the frequencies of pesticide applications affect the evolution of pesticide resistance? (3) How can the time when the pest population reaches the economic injury level (EIL) be estimated and (4) how can the most efficient frequency of pesticide applications be determined? To address these questions, we have developed a novel pest population growth model incorporating the evolution of pesticide resistance and pulse spraying of pesticides. Moreover, three pesticide switching methods, threshold condition-guided, density-guided and EIL-guided, are modelled, to determine the best choice under different conditions with the overall aim of eradicating the pest or maintaining its population density below the EIL. Furthermore, the pest control outcomes based on those three pesticide switching methods are discussed. Our results suggest that either the density-guided or EIL-guided method is the optimal pesticide switching strategy, depending on the frequency (or period) of pesticide applications.
"
,,". Introduction
Pesticide resistance is the adaptation of a pest population targeted by a pesticide, resulting in decreased susceptibility of the pest to the chemical. Pesticide resistance is increasing and farmers’ and other pest managers’ dependencies on chemical insecticides have led to a high frequency of insecticide resistance in some crop systems [1]. In the 1940s, farmers in the USA lost 7% of their crops to pests. Since the 1980s, the percentage lost has increased to 13%, even though more pesticides are being used, this is because more than 500 species of pests have developed resistance to pesticides since 1945 [2], [3], [4], and the situation is often caused by the same classes of pesticides being used repeatedly for a long time. Other problems ensue such as pest resurgence, acute and chronic health problems, environmental pollution and uneconomic crop production.

Therefore, knowledge of the mechanisms for the evolution of pesticide resistance is important for developing strategies to avoid the creation of resistance in pest populations, with the underlying principle being the preservation of susceptible genes in pest populations. Therefore, in order to fight pesticide resistance and based on a knowledge of the genetics of the development of pesticide resistance, a number of principles have been proposed aimed at delaying the emergence of resistance or avoiding it entirely. These principles include pesticide rotation or switching, avoiding unnecessary pesticide applications, using non-chemical control techniques [5], and leaving untreated refuges where susceptible pests can survive, within the concept of integrated pest management (IPM) [6], [7], [8], [9], [10].

When pesticides are the sole or predominant method of pest control, resistance is commonly managed through pesticide rotations or pesticide switches. This means after a pest species develops resistance to a particular pesticide, one method is to use a different pesticide, especially one in a different chemical class or family of pesticides that has a different mode of action against the pest. So far, switching among unrelated insecticides in response to detection of resistance has been the main method used. For instance, during the WHO Onchocerciasis Control Programme (OCP) in West Africa examples of different categories of pesticides were used in rotation after the blackfly vectors of Onchocerciasis developed resistance to the chemical of choice, the organophosphate temephos [11]. Similarly, in agriculture, insecticide rotation has been widely used to combat resistance in a major pest of brassica crops, the Diamondback Moth Plutella xylostella [12].

To achieve pest resistance management using pesticide switches or rotations, the key problems that we are facing are: What is the optimal frequency of pesticide use? How do the frequencies of pesticide applications affect the evolution of pesticide resistance and when does the pest population reach the critical threshold value?

In order to address those questions, mathematical models can be useful for determining the optimal frequency of pesticide applications, when is best to switch pesticides and for predicting how fast pesticide resistance develops. To do this, we have developed a novel pest population growth model concerning evolution of pest resistance and pulse spraying of pesticides. The model incorporates three different pesticide switching tactics for eradicating the pest or maintaining its population density below a given critical level.

The first justification for stopping the use of a given pesticide and switching a new type of pesticide (so called as pesticide switching method throughout this paper) is based on the threshold condition (the threshold condition-guided method) which ensures the extinction of the pest population, i.e. the pesticide is switched once the threshold value increases due to evolution of pesticide resistance and exceeds one, which determines the stability of pest eradication solutions.

The second pesticide switching method depends on the density of the pest population just before the pesticide is applied (the density-guided method). This switching action occurs when the efficacy of the pesticide begins to wear off, i.e. there is resurgence.

An important concept in IPM is that of the economic threshold (ET), which is usually defined as the number of pests in the field when control actions must be taken to prevent the economic injury level (EIL) from being reached and exceeded. The EIL is defined as the lowest pest population density that will cause economic damage [6], [8], [9], [10]). For an IPM strategy, action must be taken once a critical density of pests is observed in the field so that the EIL is not exceeded. Thus, the third switching action is instigated when the pest population reaches the EIL (the EIL-guided method).

We provide analytical formulae for the optimal times to switch between different unrelated pesticides for all of the above three methods. Based on different situations, the optimal choices for each of these three methods, with the intention of eradicating the pests or maintaining their population density below a tolerable level, are discussed. Our results suggest that either the density-guided or the EIL-guided method is the optimal pesticide switching strategy, depending on the frequency (or period) of the pesticide applications.

2. Pest growth model with evolution of pesticide resistance
In this section, we will develop a simple pest population growth model concerning the evolution of pest resistance. In particular, the effects of the frequency of pesticide applications are modelled and investigated. One of our main purposes is to investigate how to implement a chemical control strategy and manage pest resistance such that the pest population dies out eventually or its density is maintained below the EIL. In order to address this topic, we focus on the threshold condition which guarantees the extinction of the pest population and discuss optimal strategies for pesticide switches.

2.1. Simple pest growth model with pesticide resistance
Throughout this study, the pest population is assumed to grow logistically with an intrinsic growth rate r and a carrying capacity parameter η. Then the pest population follows

In the following, the total pest population is divided into two parts: susceptible pests (denoted by 
) and resistant pests (denoted by 
), and the proportion of susceptible pests in the population is denoted by a fraction ω, the remaining fraction 
 is resistant, so we have 
 and 
. Susceptible pests are those that have not developed resistance to the pesticide. That is to say, ω may be thought of as the stock of effectiveness of the pesticide, and it is the proportion of the pest population to which the toxin is lethal. Naturally, the susceptible pests are assumed to die with a higher mortality rate, 
, and the resistant pests are assumed to die with mortality rate, 
, when chemical control is implemented. Then the growth of susceptible and resistant pests can be modelled as follows:
(1)
However, for simplification we assume that the resistant pests display near-complete resistance to the pesticide, which means that 
 [13]. Consequently, the evolution of the total pest population follows
(2)
Since 
, then the evolution of the fraction of the susceptible pests in the total pest population is
(3)
Note that this resistance evolution equation has been widely used recently in different fields [13], [14], [15], [16], [17].

Therefore, the model (1) can be written as
(4)

In reality, the pesticides are applied instantaneously. Thus the model (4) can be developed by introducing an impulsive spraying of pesticide at a critical time and modelling the consequences of population densities changing very rapidly.

If the pesticides is applied at time point 
 for 
 with 
, where 
 and 
, then the number of pests killed at time 
 is 
. Therefore, we have the following impulsive differential equation
(5)
where 
 and 
. This indicates that the initial condition of the pest population in model (5) is chosen as the population density after the first application of pesticide at time 
.

It is clear from model (5) that the efficacy of the pesticide on the target pest population depends on the evolution of pest resistance, as the killing efficacy will decrease as pest resistance develops. A detailed analysis of model (5) will be given in the coming sections.

2.2. The effects of frequency of pesticide applications on evolution of resistance
The formula (3) indicates how the pest resistance develops with respect to time. However, it does not involve the effects of the frequency of pesticide applications, the pesticide application period or the dosage of the applications on the evolution of resistance, and those factors do influence resistance patterns. Although it is difficult to involve these factors in the model (3), we note that the speed with which resistance develops depends on several factors including the rate, timing and number of applications made. Based on this fact, we assume that at each time point 
, one pulse of pesticide is applied, which yields the following equation for the fraction of susceptible pests
(6)
with initial value 
 at each time interval 
 and 
 is given, where 
 should be a function of the number of pesticide applications, dosage 
 of the ith pesticide application and time interval 
 between the ith and 
th pesticide applications. For simplification, we assume that each time the same dosage of pesticide is applied, i.e. 
 is a constant and without loss of generality we let 
 for all 
. Thus the simplest formula for 
 could be defined as 
. For example, if 
, then the differential equation
describes the evolution of the fraction of susceptible pests at time interval 
 after the first pesticide is applied at time 
. Numerical investigations clarify that the model (6) does describe the effects of the timing and number of pesticide applications on the development of resistance, as shown in Fig. 1."

 be a constant T (i.e. pesticide applied periodically) and show the effects of different periods on the evolution of ω. In Fig. 1 four curves for 
 are plotted with respect to 
 and constant 1, from which it is clear how the frequency of pesticide applications and different 
 functions affect the evolution of pest resistance, i.e. the higher the frequency of pesticide applications, the faster the evolution of pest resistance. For simplicity, we will focus on the periodical applications of pesticides in the rest of this work.

The analytical solution of Eq. (6) can be solved as
(7)
which indicates that

If we apply pesticide periodically, i.e. 
 for all 
, then the evolution of ω at each time point nT can be expressed as

 satisfies Eq. (3), then
(10)

3. Threshold conditions and justifications and the optimal time to switch pesticides
3.1. Threshold condition for pest extinction
If we take into account the effects of the frequency of pesticide applications on the evolution of pest resistance, then model (5) becomes the following periodic control model
(11)
where T is the period of pesticide application and 
.

Note that the third equation of model (11) is independent of the pest population, and then 
 can be analytically solved which is given by (9).

Furthermore, the density of the pest population in the first equation of model (11) can be solved as
(12)
for any pulse interval 
. Therefore,
(13)
Denote 
, then we have the following non-autonomous difference equation
(14)
this is similar to the well-known Beverton–Holt model [18], [19], [20]. Note that the difference Eq. (14) is very dynamic since 
 depends on the third equation of model (11), which indicates that the difference equation discussed in present work is much more difficult than those in references [21], [22], [23]. In fact, the non-autonomous or impulsive Beverton–Holt difference equations have been studied extensively. For example, the asymptotic properties of Beverton–Holt difference equation have been discussed by Berezansky and Braverman [21] and Kocic [22], [23]. In this work, based on our practical problem we are interested in the stability of zero solution of Eq. (14). It is seen that the inequality
holds true for all 
. So we can define the dynamic threshold value 
 as follows
(15)
with 
 is given by (9). Therefore, if 
 for all 
, then the zero solution of Eq. (14), i.e. non-autonomous difference Eq. (14), is globally asymptotically stable.

This indicates that the pest population will die out if the threshold value 
 for all 
. The threshold value is very dynamic and depends on the number of pesticide applications, and we will show this in more detail later.

In particular, if 
 for 
 (i.e. 
 satisfies Eq. (3)), then
(16)

Note that, in reality, 
 may hold true for the first few pesticide applications and then it will increase and exceed 1 due to the evolution of pest resistance. Fig. 2 provides an example to show how the density of the pest population and the threshold value 
 change as the number of pesticide applications increases. If we fixed all parameter values as those in Fig. 2 and let period T vary, Fig. 2(a) gives three numerical solutions with different period T. Here we stop to integrate Eq. (11) until the density of the pest population exceeds a given threshold value TH (such as EIL). It is seen that the density of the pest population at time points nT decreases firstly due to the high efficacy of the pesticides, and then increases because of the evolution of pest resistance. For more details, see Fig. 3. The threshold value 
 corresponding to three solutions in Fig. 2(a) at each time point nT is given in Fig. 2(b)."

It is interesting to note that resurgence by the pest population can occur very quickly once the pest resistance develops. Fig. 2(a) also shows that the less frequent (larger period T) are the pesticide applications, the higher the level that pest outbreaks can reach. However, as mentioned before, the higher the frequency of pesticide applications, the faster the evolution of pest resistance. Therefore, the question is how to manage the pest resistance, i.e. what is the optimal time to switch to a new type of pesticide? We address this question in the following subsection.

3.2. Justifications and the optimal time to switch pesticides
As mentioned in the introduction, the density of resistant pests will grow quickly if one kind of pesticide is sprayed frequently (as shown in Fig. 2(a)), and it will lead to a pest outbreak or resurgence. Therefore, people usually switch pesticides at some given time and how to choose the optimal time for a switch is an important practical question. In the following, we will provide three different methods based on our model (11) to choose the optimal time for switching pesticides according to different justifications. We should emphasize that for each new type of pesticide, we assume that the evolution of pesticide resistance, i.e. ω, follows the same equation and has the same initial condition 
.

Method 1 Optimal time for switching pesticides with 
 as a guide.

It follows from Fig. 2(b) that 
 is increasing with respect to n. Therefore, in order to eradicate the pest population we should maintain 
 to hold true for all 
. This clarifies that we need to switch the pesticide once the threshold value 
 goes to one. Without loss of generality, we assume that the threshold value 
 will exceed one unit after 
 pesticide applications, i.e.
(17)
In order to find 
, we let 
, then

 is given by (9). Therefore,
and [a] denotes the greatest integer no larger than a.

In particular, if 
 then 
. Let 
, we can solve the above equation with respect to n and yield the optimal switching time 
, where

If we switch pesticides according to this decision strategy, i.e. a threshold condition-guided method, then the pest population can be completely eradicated after several pesticide switches. To show this, Fig. 4(a) depicts numerical simulation under this strategy. It follows from Fig. 4(a) that the pest population will die out eventually, where 
. That is after three pesticide applications of one kind of pesticide (note that the first pesticide application is at time 
), the farmers must switch to another kind of pesticide to eradicate the pest quickly.
"
,,"ig. 3 provides an example to show how the different spraying periods affect the density of the pest population, the time τ and spraying number 
. Fig. 4(d) gives the numerical simulation under this tactic of switching pesticides, from which we can see that the control action will tend to periodic control after a certain number of times that the pesticides are switched, where 
. It follows from Fig. 3(b) that the time τ is not a monotonic function of the spraying period, while the minimum number of pesticide applications 
 is decreasing as T increases (see Fig. 3(c)). In practice, one of the main purposes of pest resistance management is to delay the evolution of resistance under condition of eradication of the pest population or maintaining its density below EIL. Our results presented in Fig. 3 show that the relationship between τ and T is complex. Thus, how to choose the spraying times and how to manage pest resistance such that the pest control is cost-effective is a challenge.

4. Comparison of the three methods for deciding the optimal time to switch pesticides
From the above discussion, we know that the pest population dies out under the threshold value-guided method, and it follows from Fig. 4(b) and (c) that the pest population either dies out or tends to a periodic solution under the 
 guided method, depending on the period of pesticide applications, while the pest population oscillates with a maximum value TH under the EIL guided method. The question is which method is an optimal choice in practice? We discuss this question below.

We first would like to derive the conditions to determine if the pest population dies out or oscillates periodically under the density of pest population 
 guided method.

Let 
 be the number of effective pesticide applications of the ith pesticide switches and 
 is the pest population at time kT after the ith pesticide switch, that is 
 and 
. According to Eq. (18) we have
(22)

Denote 
, then we have the following difference equation
(23)

Again this is the well-known Beverton–Holt model, which has a zero equilibrium 
. It is stable provided that
(24)
If 
, then (23) has a stable positive equilibrium

Let 
 be the solution of equation 
, then if 
, the pest population will die out after several pesticide switchings, and if 
, the pest population will fluctuate periodically.

Therefore, if we aim to eradicate the pest population and the period of pesticide applications must satisfy 
, our results support the density guided method (i.e. method 2) because of 
, as shown in Fig. 4(b).

If the period of pesticide applications T is larger than 
, then the periodic switching of pesticides will result in oscillating of the pest population periodically under the density guided method, as shown in Fig. 4(c). However, for this case the amplitude of the pest population could be very large and its maximum value can exceed EIL (i.e. 
), which will result in great economic loss. These results confirm that if 
, the tactic of switching pesticides with the EIL-guided method is better than the tactic of switching pesticides with the density guided method, because the EIL-guided method is in good agreement with the aims of an IPM strategy, that is control action must be taken once a critical density of the pests is observed in the field so that the EIL is not exceeded [6], [8], [9], [10].

5. Discussion
Chemical methods in IPM are the most direct and effective[6], [8], [9], [10]. However, frequent use of one kind of pesticide in the long-term may create selection pressure for evolution of pest resistance to the pesticide. If too large a proportion of a pest population develops resistance to the pesticide toxin, the susceptibility of the entire pest population to the pesticide toxin will be lost eventually, leading to pest resurgences and outbreaks.

Natural enemies may keep a pest population relatively stable in the absence of any pesticide application. Indeed, a key component of an IPM strategy is often biological control [24], [25], which is defined as the reduction of pest populations by natural enemies. It typically involves impulsive perturbations, such as the release of natural enemies at a critical time of the season when insufficient reproduction of the natural enemies already present is likely to occur and pest control will be achieved exclusively by the released individuals themselves (augmentation) [26], [27].

Pulse-like pest management actions such as spraying pesticides and killing a pest instantly and the release of natural enemies at critical times can be modelled with impulsive differential equations. Recently, many mathematical models with impulsive chemical control tactics and releases of natural enemies have been proposed to model an IPM strategy such as spraying of pesticides [25], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33] or releases of natural enemies at critical times [27], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41]. Those studies mainly focused on the effects of chemical control and biological control on the permanence or extinction of pest populations, and did not consider the effects of pesticide resistance. In particular, they paid no attention to questions such as (1) how to determine the period of pesticide switches? (2) What is the optimal justification for switching from one kind pesticide to another, unrelated, new kind pesticide? And (3) how to determine the time when the density of the pest population reaches or exceeds EIL? All these questions are key issues for the management of pesticide resistance and applying cost-effective pest control strategies in practice.

To answer such questions, we developed a pest population growth model including pesticide resistance. In particular, we investigated how the number of pesticide applications or the frequency of pesticide applications affects the evolution of pesticide resistance, and consequently affects the success or failure of pest control.

In particular, we have provided three possible methods which can help us to judge when we should switch pesticides: the threshold condition-guided method; the density of pest population-guided method and the EIL-guided method. If we want to completely eradicate the pest population, then the threshold condition-guided method or density-guided method can be employed to determine the frequency of pesticide switches. However, our results confirm that if we properly choose the period of pesticide application, the density-guided method is better than the threshold condition-guided method in terms of the timing for pesticide switching. Moreover, the method for determining the period of pesticide applications is also provided. We also would like to point out that this guided method may be easily implemented in practice, because we only need to record the density of the pest population at the time of each pulse spraying of pesticides and monitor the density at the most recent time of pulse spraying. But we should emphasize here that the period of pesticide applications must be carefully designed based on our method.

If we want to maintain the density of pests below some predefined threshold value such as EIL rather than eradicating the pest population, then the density-guided method or EIL-guided method can be employed to determine the frequency of pesticide switches. Our results confirm that the EIL-guided method should also be used to determine the timing of pesticide applications, due to the uncertainties involved in the density-guided method, i.e. the amplitude of the pest population may be very large (vast pest outbreaks may occur, e.g. in locust populations) if the period of pesticide applications is not chosen properly. Moreover, the EIL-guided method can maintain the density of pest populations below the EIL forever, which is one of the main purposes of IPM strategies [6], [8], [9], [10], [42]. Note that the time when the pest population grows and reaches the EIL is not monotonic with respect to the frequency of the pesticide applications. This indicates that although the effects of the pesticide naturally wear off with the increasing of spraying times, the effects of the period of pesticide applications on their timing τ shown in Fig. 3 is complex.

To avoid multiple resistance, we need to adopt the IPM approach [7]. Therefore, we will extend our single pest population growth model to include natural enemies in the future. Due to the pesticide wearing off, repeated releases of the same number of natural enemies is either insufficient as they no longer suppress the pest population once the pest resistance develops, or the number released is too large which is not cost effective and may cause secondary outbreaks or pest resurgence. If so, how should one determine the new number of natural enemies to be released at each control action? This question will be addressed in future research. Meanwhile, the growth rate of a pest population can be strongly impacted by environmental conditions, thus the pest control strategies should be adaptable to changing conditions. Therefore, both stochasticity in growth rate and the ability to adapt control methods in response to changing conditions will be also addressed to make the model more realistic and practical.

,,"Abstract
Pesticides provide growers with an effective tool for the control of damaging crop pests preventing yield losses that could jeopardise food security. In recent years the potentially adverse effects of their use on human health and the environment has received increasing attention by the public and the competent authorities. In this context reliable pesticide risk indicators are pivotal to assess the potential risk associated with the use of pesticide. Several pesticide risk indicators, serving various purposes, have been developed over the years. Recently, a new pesticide risk indicator, the Pesticide Load (PL), was introduced in Denmark. The PL has replaced the Treatment Frequency Index (TFI) as the official pesticide risk indicator. The PL consists of three sub-indicators for human health, ecotoxicology and environmental fate, respectively. For each of the three sub-indicators a pesticide load (PL) is calculated and expressed as the PL per unit commercial product (kg, L or tablet). PL for human health (PLHH) is based on the risk phrases on the product label, while PL for ecotoxicology (PLECO) is calculated on basis of the LC/LD/EC50 values of the active ingredients for acute toxicity to mammals, birds, fish, daphnia, algae, aquatic plants, earthworms and bees and NOEC values for chronic toxicity to fish, daphnia and earthworms. PL for environmental fate (PLFATE) is calculated on basis of the half-life in soil (DT50), the bioaccumulation factor (BCF) and the SCI-GROW index. PL does not consider the actual exposure, i.e. it reflects the relative risks associated with the use of pesticides. Besides using PL for monitoring the yearly trend in pesticide use and load, the PL was also used for setting up a new pesticide tax scheme and for setting quantitative reduction targets. In Denmark, it is now compulsory for farmers to upload their pesticide use data, i.e. the annual pesticide statistics and the calculation of the PL can be produced on basis of pesticide use data rather than sales data that may not reflect the actual use by farmers. Because pesticide use data is available for each farm, maps providing detailed information on pesticide use in different regions can be produced. From 2010/11 to 2013/14 only minor differences were observed in the PL and, overall, similar trends were observed for the PL and TFI. Significant geographical differences, which could be attributed to differences in crop rotations, were apparent when estimating PL for each of the four major groups of pesticides (herbicides, fungicides, insecticides and plant growth regulators). The maps produced from the pesticide use data revealed significant variation in PL for ecotoxicological effects on aqueous organisms and bees as well as environmental parameters such as leaching potential. It is suggested to use the maps to identify ‘hot spots’ and design monitoring programmes or to launch initiatives that can reduce the PL. By linking information on mode of action to each commercial pesticide product it was also possible to obtain detailed information on the use pattern of the various pesticide modes of action, which is relevant information assessing the risk of evolution of pesticide resistance.

1. Introduction
In several European countries, including Denmark, an increasing public awareness of the potentially adverse effects of pesticides on human health and the environment has translated into pesticide action plans aimed at reducing or restricting the use of pesticides or the adverse impacts of pesticide use and promoting integrated pest management (IPM) and organic farming practices (Lamichhane et al., 2016). In 2009, the European Union adopted Directive 128/2009EC establishing a framework for EU actions to promote a sustainable use of pesticides (European Commission, 2009). According to the directive EU member states are obliged to promote low pesticide-input pest management defined as IPM or organic farming. The directive lists eight general IPM principles that all professional users of pesticides have had to comply with since 1. January 2014 (Barzman et al., 2015).

IPM programmes were in place in Switzerland and Italy (Barzman et al., 2015, Galassi and Sattin, 2014) prior to the adoption of Directive 128/2009EC but otherwise IPM has not previously been promoted in Europe. It is implicit assumed that adoption of IPM by EU farmers will reduce the risks associated with the use of pesticides but the directive does not set specific goals. It is, however, foreseen that harmonised indicators should be developed to provide tools to monitor the beneficial impact of a wider adopting of IPM practices.

Since the 1990′ies, several pesticide risk indicators have been developed and a few studies have compared specific components of some of the pesticide risk indicators (e.g. Reus et al., 2002, Bockstaller et al., 2008). One of earliest and most widely used risk indicators is the Environmental Impact Quotient (EIQ) (Kovach et al., 1992). The EIQ consists of three components, a farm worker component aggregating human toxicity information, a consumer component aggregating human chronic toxicity, pesticide fate in soil and food and leaching to groundwater and an ecological component adding up effects on aquatic and terrestrial organisms. For each parameter evaluated EIQ uses a rating system from 1 (least harmful) to 5 (most harmful). The overall EIQ is expressed as the average value of the three components. The EIQ has been applied in studies assessing trends in impact of pesticides in orchard fruit in the UK over years (Cross, 2012), reduced risk programmes versus conventional pesticide programmes (Biddinger et al., 2014), the environmental impact of glyphosate resistant weeds in Canada (Beckie et al., 2013) and in studies comparing cropping systems based on conventionally bred crops with genetically-modified herbicide resistant crops both ex-ante (Tillie et al., 2014) and ex-post (Stewart et al., 2011).

SYNOPS is a risk indicator developed in Germany to assess environmental risks (Gutsche and Rossberg, 1997). Besides pesticide use data SYNOPS also requires information on crop stage, application technique, soil type, location, topography of the field etc. Based on this information, SYNOPS calculates the Predicted Environmental Concentrations (PEC) for different compartments and compare the PEC values to the LC50 and NOEC values for the various target organisms and Exposure Toxicity Ratios (ETR) are calculated for each target organism. In contrast to EIQ, SYNOPS considers the effect of mitigation measures such as buffer zones or low drift spraying equipment because the concept is based on the calculation of PEC values. SYNOPS was developed to assess the environmental risks at farm or regional level but not at national level. Recently, a web-based version of SYNOPS (SYNOPS-WEB) was launched (Strassemeyer et al., 2017). In addition, a modified version of SYNOPS named SYNOPS-TREND has been developed to assess environmental risk based on sales data for comparing the impact of pesticide use over several years (Gutsche and Strassemeyer, 2007).

I-Phy (former name Ipest) was developed by van der Werf and Zimmer (1998) and is a so-called fuzzy expert system. I-Phy calculates the risk of surface water contamination, risk of groundwater contamination and risk of air contamination based on information on pesticide properties, site specific conditions and application conditions. I-Phy has been used to assess the sustainability of cropping systems in France (Bockstaller et al., 2008, Chikowo et al., 2009) and recently an improved groundwater module was published (Lindahl and Bockstaller, 2012).

Another pesticide risk indicator is the Environmental Yardstick for Pesticides (EYP) developed in the Netherlands (Reus and Leendertse, 2000). Like SYNOPS, the EYP also calculates PEC values but rather than comparing these values to LC/LD/EC/ED50 and NOEC values they are multiplied by pesticide toxicity data to produce Environmental Impact Points. As the name indicates the EYP only considers environmental effects of pesticides. EYP is not as widely used, as for example EIQ, but has been applied to assess the impact of pesticide use in integrated and conventional potato production in the Netherlands (De Jong and De Snoo, 2002).

In an EU project entitled ‘Harmonized environmental indicators for pesticide risk (HAIR)’ a set of indicators were developed. In the years following the termination of the project work has been ongoing improving and developing additional indicators that are available online (http://www.pesticidemodels.eu/hair/home). The HAIR indicators are intended for calculating trends in aggregated risks of the agricultural use of pesticides.

The abovementioned risk indicators were developed solely with the purpose to assess the risk of pesticide use. The Norwegian pesticide risk indicator (NERI) was developed with a dual purpose, as a tool to assess the risk of pesticide use and as a method for taxation of pesticides (Stenrød et al., 2008). Like EIQ, NERI is a rating system. For human health NERI classifies products into 4 risk classes (low, medium, high and very high risk) according to the risk phrases on the label. NERI also considers the risk of operator exposure when preparing the spray mixture and when applying the pesticide by multiplying the scores for human health with scores for formulation type and application method. Environmental risk is assessed by adding up scores for effects on earthworms, bees, birds, aquatic organisms, mobility and leaching potential, persistence, bioaccumulation and a score for formulation type. Based on the accumulated score NERI classifies products into three environmental risk classes. By combining the information on human health and environmental risk classifications products are grouped into 7 pesticide tax classes.

As a response to the implementation of Directive 128/2009/EC that requires that the adverse impact of pesticides on human health and the environment and not pesticide use per se is reduced the Danish authorities decided to develop a pesticide risk indicator that could serve not only to monitor pesticide load and but also to set quantitative targets. Hence, a new indicator, named the Pesticide Load (PL), has therefore replaced the Treatment Frequency Index (TFI), which has been in use in Denmark since 1986. The TFI expresses the frequency of pesticide treatments and is therefore not a risk indicator but it has been perceived as a proxy for a pesticide risk indicator. The TFI is calculated by dividing the total amounts of active ingredients used in each crop by the standard doses assigned to each use of the active ingredient (Kudsk, 1989, Gravesen, 2003). Pesticides have been subjected to a value added tax in Denmark since 1990 and further objective was to develop an indicator that could enable a change in the taxation system from a tax linked to the costs of a pesticide to a tax linked to the risks.

Until recently, the annual computation of the TFI was solely based on the annual sales figures. Besides being reported per calendar year and not per growing season, the sales figures are also influenced e.g. by stockpiling and weather conditions precluding application of pesticides already purchased by the farmers. Along with the launching of the PL it was decided to make it compulsory for Danish farmers to upload an extract of their spray records to a website administered by the Ministry of Environment and Food. Starting with the growing season 2010/11, it has been compulsory for farmers to submit information electronically on their pesticide use. Farmers with less than 10 ha of land or with a turnover lower than ca. 6700 EUR are exempted from the obligation to report. For each crop, information should be provided on each commercial products used from 1 August to 31 July, the dose applied of each product and the total area treated with the product.

The objective of this paper is to present the underlying principles of the PL, how the PL is applied to monitor pesticide use and load and to provide examples on how the PL, in combination with the information from the spray records, can provide detailed information not only on the pesticide load but also on important agronomic issues. Finally, future uses of the PL intended to target monitoring and mitigation procedures are presented and discussed.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Calculation of the pesticide load and tax
The PL consists of three sub-indicators: human health, ecotoxicology and environmental fate. For each of three sub-indicators a pesticide load (PL) is calculated and expressed as the PL per unit commercial product (kg, L or tablet).

PL for human health (PLHH) is based on the risk phrases on the label of the product, i.e. primarily operator exposure is considered. Every risk phrase is given a score between 10 and 100. The highest score of 100 points is given to products that are highly toxic or can cause irreversible damage (e.g. heritable genetic risks or cancer) while skin irritation or respiratory irritation only generates 10 points. The points for each risk phrase are added up. Formulations of products are also considered to have an impact on exposure with powder and concentrated liquid formulations providing higher risks compared with e.g. tablets and ready-to-use formulations. The total score is converted to pesticide load points by dividing the score by 300. The value 300 was used to ensure that the contribution of PLHH to the overall PL was close to 1/3 in the reference year chosen to be 2007.

The PL for ecotoxicology (PLECO) is determined using LC/LD/EC50 and NOEC values from the Pesticide Property Database (PPDB) (Lewis et al., 2016). Eight input parameters relate to acute toxicity to mammals, birds, fish, daphnia, algae, aquatic plants, earthworms and bees while 3 relate to chronic toxicity on fish, daphnia and earthworms. They were chosen because applicants are obliged to provide data for these parameters. The values for chronic toxicity were adjusted for degradation rate of the active ingredient in case the half-life values in soil and water were available, i.e. an active ingredient with a short half-life triggered a lower score than one with long half-life. The PL for environmental fate (PLFATE) is made up of three input parameters, the half-life in soil (DT50), the bioaccumulation factor (BCF) (or the log Pow value if no BCF value is reported) and the SCI-GROW index (US-EPA, 2007) that reflects the mobility and risk of leaching to the groundwater of the active ingredient and the major metabolites listed in the PPDB database. While PLHH is calculated on basis of the properties of the commercial products both PLECO and PLFATE are derived based on the properties of the active ingredients.

For both PLECO and PLFATE the most harmful pesticide active ingredients registered in Denmark within each input parameter (lowest LC/LD/EC50 and NOEC values, longest DT50, highest BCF and SCI-GROW index) has been defined as the reference active ingredient and is allocated the maximum number of PL points per kg active ingredient (Table 1). The number of PL points for all other active ingredients are expressed relative to the reference active ingredient, i.e. if a LD50 value is 10 times higher the number of PL points will be 10 times lower. The reference active ingredient will remain the same if an active ingredient more toxic, persistent or mobile than the reference active ingredient is marketed or if the reference active ingredient is withdrawn from the market. By doing so PL values from different years can be compared. The maximum number of PL points allocated per kg active ingredients varies for each input parameter and use. For example, for acute toxicity of active ingredients applied as a spray the maximum number of PL points for bees is 100 compared to 1 for birds and mammals. Aquatic organisms like fish and daphnia are in between with a maximum value of 30. Similarly, for PLFATE the maximum number of PL points for mobility is 20 compared to 2.5 for half-life and bioaccumulation. The differences in maximum PL points reflect that the major concerns in Denmark regarding the current use of pesticides are adverse effects on bees/pollinators, aquatic organisms and leaching to the groundwater. The higher maximum number of PL points implies that pesticides adversely affecting bees/pollinators and aquatic organisms or presenting a high risk to the groundwater will score higher and be imposed a higher tax.

Bioaccumulation	Bio-concentration factor	5100	Pendimethalin

The maximum PL points also depend on the method of application. For active ingredients applied as a seed dressing the maximum number of PL points for acute toxicity to bees is 1 while the maximum value is 10 for birds and mammals due to a higher risk of exposure than for spray applications.

The total PLECO and PLFATE are derived by converting the PL points per kg active ingredient for each input parameter to PL points per unit product taking into account the concentration of active ingredient(s) in the commercial formulation and subsequently summarizing the PL points for all input parameters. Finally, the total PL for each unit of product is calculated by adding up PLHH, PLECO and PLFATE. Another premise developing the PL was that PLECO, PLFATE, and PLHH each should contribute ca. 1/3 to the overall PL in the reference year reflecting that the adverse effects on human health, ecotoxicological effects and environmental fate were considered to be equally important.

Detailed information on the principles underlying the new indicator examples on how the data can be broken down e.g. by crop either a national level or per hectare can be found elsewhere (Anon, 2012). An overview of the input parameters contributing to ecotoxicological and environmental fate assessment, maximum PL points for each input parameter and the reference active ingredients is given in Table 1.

The pesticide tax is calculated as 107 DKK (14.30 EUR) per PL plus 50 DKK (6.70 EUR) per kg active ingredient. Taking the pesticides in Table 1 as an example, it is evident that the pesticide tax varies significantly and do have a major impact the overall costs of the pesticides. The new pesticide tax went in force in June 2013.

2.2. Data collection and analysis
Pesticide use data reported by the farmers for the growing seasons 2010/11, 2011/12, 2012/13 and 2013/14 were used to estimate the TFI and PL including the three sub-indicators PLHH, PLECO and PLFATE (Gravesen, 2003, Anon, 2012). The information uploaded by the farmers was quality assured by checking for misspellings of product names, obvious mistakes in the amounts reported and mismatches between pesticides and crops reported. The total cultivated area reported by farmers made up 76, 89, 89 and 90% of the area cropped with arable crops over the four years. For horticultural crops, nursery crops and Christmas trees only 46–61% of the area was covered by the reports received from the farmers but as horticultural crops only covers around 2% of the total cropped area in Denmark it was not considered to have any significant influence on the overall results.

The data were analysed in two different ways. Firstly the data were aggregated and the TFI, PL, PLHH, PLECO and PLFATE were estimated at a national level for each growing season and pesticide group to compare the overall trends over the four growing seasons. Secondly, the data was used to produce maps visualizing the geographical variation in TFI, PL and the sub-indicators PLHH, PLECO and PLFATE and also some of the input parameters making up the three sub-indicators. The resolution of the maps is by parish. In total, pesticide use data from 1.94 m hectares of conventional cropped land was included in the analyses. Data were available from 1987 out of 2169 parishes, and, on average, each of the 1987 parishes covered 975 ha. The remaining parishes were located in urban areas.

Considering that variations in PL and the sub-indicators were minor between years the PL maps show the average PL of the four growing seasons (2011/12–2013/14). Colouring of the PL maps is not based on specific values but represents merely the distribution of the calculated values. Blue represents the 8.33% lowest values and red the 8.33% highest values while the ten colour codes in between depict a linear scale with each colour code representing 8.33% of the interval between the lowest and highest values. It should be emphasised that the red colour does not indicate a problem or an unacceptable level but merely that the highest values were recorded in that area. Black spots represent urban areas while grey spots represent areas with no farming activity, e.g. lakes and forests. For each pesticide product information was added on the mode of action of the active ingredient(s) contained in the product following the guidelines published by the Herbicide Resistance Action Committee (http://www.hracglobal.com), Fungicide Resistance Action Committee (http://www.frac.info) and Insecticide Resistance Committee (http://www.irac-online.org) which allowed us also to present pesticide use in terms of mode of actions.

3. Results
3.1. TFI and PL in the growing seasons 2010/11–2013/14
An example with two pesticides representing each end of the scale within each of the four major pesticide groups is shown in Table 2. Even though the two fungicides differ significantly in their overall PL, PLHH was the main contributor to PL, as it is the case with the majority of the fungicides. In contrast, environmental fate and ecotoxicology were the main concerns with the two herbicides and two insecticides, respectively, and a similar trend was observed for the majority of the registered herbicides and insecticides. For chlormequat chloride ecotoxicology was the main issue while human health was main source of PL points with trinexapac-ethyl. Generally plant growth regulators (PGR) vary more when it comes to the relative contribution of PLHH, PLECO and PLFATE to the overall PL than fungicides, herbicides and insecticides.

The reduction in pesticide use from 2010/11 to 2011/12 led to a reduction in the national mean PL of 16% and, despite TFI increased slightly from 2011/12 to 2012/13, PL decreased by 6% (Table 3). In contrast, the increase in TFI of ca. 9% from 2012/13 to 2013/14 was accompanied by an increase in PL of ca. 5% but PL was comparable to the 2011/12 level despite TFI being ca. 10% higher. Overall, the trends observed in the TFI were also reflected in the PL but minor deviations were observed.

The contribution of the four pesticide groups to the average PLHH, PLECO and PLFATE is shown in Table 4. Only minor changes were observed in the relative contribution of the three sub-indicators over the four growing seasons. Despite a continuous increase in the use of PGRs during the four growing seasons (TFI went up from 3 to 6%) their contribution to the overall pesticide load was still marginal. Herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and PGRs contributions to the overall PL were 39–42%, 25–28%, 29–35% and 1.4–2.2%, respectively. The greater variation observed for fungicides reflect that disease pressure varied more than insect pest and weed pressure. The relative contribution of PLHH, PLECO and PLFATE to the overall PL varied from 30 to 33%, 39 to 41% and 28 to 29%, respectively.

3.2. PL maps
The farming industry in Denmark is highly specialised with dairy farming being located in the western part and, in particular, in the far-west and south-western part of the country, an area dominated by lighter soils. Pig farming is also pre-dominantly found in the western part but more evenly spread in that part of the country compared to dairy farms and often found on more fertile soils. The eastern part with its loamy soils is primarily arable farming growing winter wheat, winter oilseed rape, grass and clover seed crops and sugar beets (south-eastern corner of the country) (http://www.agricultureandfood.dk/prices-statistics/annual-statistics; http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Agricultural_census_in_Denmark).

The variation in TFI on a national basis for each of the four pesticide groups is shown in Fig. 1. Use pattern varied significantly between regions. Whereas herbicide and insecticide use is highest in the eastern part of the country (the islands and along the eastern coast of the peninsula Jutland) where arable farming and pig farming is the most common agricultural production, it is lowest in the western part where the dairy farms are located and maize and grassland are the main crops. The main difference in herbicide and insecticide use is an area in the central Jutland where herbicide use is low but insecticide use is high. This is an area with intensive potato cultivation. The whole potato-growing area becomes very visible on the fungicide map as large red spots in the central and smaller red spot in the northern part of Jutland reflecting the high use of fungicides against potato late blight, caused by the fungus Phytophthora infestans, and recently also early blight caused by Alternaria solani. The differences in TFI for fungicides, insecticides and PGRs are more pronounced than for herbicides with TFI varying from 0.2 to 2.2 (a ratio of 11), 0.04 to 0.66 (ratio of 16.5) and 0 to 0.4 (ratio higher than 10) compared to 0.7 to 2.0 (ratio of 2.9) for herbicides. PGRs are primarily used in cereal crops and grass seed crops that are grown in th eastern part of the country."

Colouring of the maps is not based on specific values but represents the distribution of the calculated values. Blue represents the 8.33% lowest values and red the 8.33% highest values while the ten colour codes in between depict a linear scale with each colour code representing 8.33% of the interval between the lowest and highest values. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

A very good agreement was found between TFI and PL reflected as an almost identical distribution of the colour codes on the two maps in Fig. 2. In general, a high pesticide use also resulted in a high PL, despite the fact that the contribution of the various pesticide groups to the overall pesticide use varied significantly between geographical regions. However, splitting the overall PL up into the three sub-indicators PLHH, PLECO, PLFATE revealed differences although the south-eastern part of Denmark generally scored highest for all 3 sub-indicators (Fig. 3). A high PLHH and PLECO coincided with the more intensively cultivated regions on the islands and the eastern coast of the peninsula. The only marked difference was the higher PLECO values in the potato-growing areas reflecting that PLECO of one of the most widely used fungicides in potato, mancozeb, contributes significantly to the overall PL of fungicides in contrast to several of the cereal fungicides. The highest PLFATE was observed in the south-eastern part of the country, an area with a high average herbicide use due to a high frequency of sugar beets in the crop rotation.

4. Discussion
The spray records provide a unique source of information on pesticide use by Danish farmers. The information is used for statistical purposes and for monitoring changes in pesticide use and load and to assess changes in use patterns over the years. Currently, the primary use of the data is for the annual publication on pesticide use in agriculture and horticulture. By combining the detailed use data with the new risk indicator pesticide use can be expressed both as TFI and PL values. Using pesticide use data rather than sales data provides a more realistic picture of pesticide use as, e.g. effects of stockpiling caused by market-related issues such as price fluctuations or climatic conditions preventing the farmers from applying already purchased pesticides will not be reflected in the statistics. The weakness of a pesticide use statistics based on sales figures was highlighted in 2008 when the PL increased by 59% compared to 2007 due to stockpiling of insecticides that would become significantly more expensive with the PL-based tax (Anon, 2012).

The authors are only aware of one other example where detailed information on pesticide use data is collected systematically and that is the Pesticide Use Reporting system in California where it has been compulsory for farmers to submit data on their pesticide use since 1990 (http://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/pur/purmain.htm). Californian farmers are obliged to report their pesticide use data to the county agricultural commissioners who upload the information to a public website from where it is possible to extract information on pesticide use per crop, county, township etc. In contrast to the Danish system, pesticide use data is presented as amount of active ingredient and there is no overall assessment of the risk associated with pesticide use although from 1996 and onwards pesticide use has been monitored for specific categories of pesticides like the ones classified as being reproductive toxins, carcinogenic or ground water contaminants.

The absence of a significant reduction in the PL over the four growing seasons can probably be contributed to the fact that the new taxation system went in force in June 2013, i.e. it only affected pesticide prices in 2013/14. Furthermore, as farmers already a year ahead of the introduction of the new tax scheme knew which pesticides would be imposed the highest taxes extensive stockpiling took place. This was reflected in a 240% increase in PL calculated on basis of the sales data in 2012, the last year before the introductions of the new pesticide tax, compared to 2014, the first year with the new tax (data not shown).

One way to reduce the PL is to substitute pesticides with high PLs with pesticides with lower PLs whenever possible. Substituting epoxiconazole by prothioconazole and cypermethrin by lambda-cyhalothrin will reduce PL by 77 and 80%, respectively. However, substitution between active ingredients is not always possible due to different authorisations, efficacy profiles or the risk of pesticide resistance. Nonetheless, it is expected that PL will decrease in the years to come when farmers have used up their stocks and the use of low-PL and low-taxed products will increase. In the short term substitution of compounds with high PL values by those with lower PL values will be the major cause of an overall reduction in PL but in the long term also the adoption of IPM is expected to contribute to a lower PL.

The maps in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5 illustrate that the majority of Denmark is farmland and that pesticides are used in most parishes. Hence, it is not surprising that pesticide use has received a lot of attention by the general public in Denmark. For many years the TFI was used as the national pesticide use indicator and also for setting quantitative reduction targets. TFI is superior to expressing pesticide use as amounts of active ingredients sold or used as the TFI also reflects spraying intensity. The TFI was considered a kind of a proxy for a risk indicator although the TFI does not reflect impact, but with the implementation of Directive 128/2009EC, requiring that not the use but the adverse impacts of pesticides should be minimized, the TFI was replaced by the risk indicator PL. Although the differences in TFI and PL between the four growing were minor the pesticide use data showed that the TFI can increase or decrease without a concomitant increase or decrease in the PL. The reason is that PL is influenced not only by the total pesticide use but also by farmers’ choice of active ingredients. If farmers shift to pesticides with low PL values, the overall PL can be reduced significantly without a concomitant reduction in TFI, however, this is not always possible because of the absence on the market of ‘low PL products’ with a comparable biological performance or because it would jeopardise a pesticide resistance management strategy in place.

A clear weakness of the PL is that it does not consider exposure. For pesticides with high risks mitigation measures like buffer zones along water bodies for products with high toxicity to aquatic organisms or protective clothes when handling toxic compounds are considered during the authorization process. If mitigation measures are in place the actual impact of the pesticides in question will be significantly less than reflected by the PL and the derived pesticide tax. Nonetheless, the need for a transparent system involving no subjective assessments, like the drift values required to estimate e.g. exposure of non-target organisms, that would restrict the use PL for taxing purposes carried more weight than reflecting more accurately the field conditions. Developing a risk indicator that considers site specific information is a considerable bigger task, as exemplified by the time and resources that have been invested in the German SYNOPS risk indicator that was introduced in the mid-90s (Gutsche and Rossberg, 1997) and still is being developed and refined (Strassemeyer et al., 2017).

The available pesticide risk indicators differ in two ways. One concerns whether they consider effects on both human health and environment or only environment. EIQ, NERI and PL belong to the first group while SYNPOS, I-Phy and EYP only consider impact on the environment. The other feature distinguishing the risk indicators is whether the assessment of the environmental impact is solely based on the inherent properties of the products/active ingredients or the indicators also consider exposure e.g. by including information on the application method, crop stage and site specific conditions such as topography. EIQ, NERI and PL belong to the first group while SYNOPS, I-Phy and EYP belong to the second group.

A pesticide risk indicator based solely on the inherent properties like PL reflects a worst case scenario while pesticide risk indicators considering exposure aim at simulating the actual conditions in a specific field/region. Using a pesticide risk indicator for taxation purposes requires that the underlying calculations are transparent and can lead to only one result. As taxation was one of the objectives of developing PL it was never considered to include an exposure module.

Over the years TFI has been used to set quantitative reduction targets (Kudsk and Jensen, 2014). When replacing the TFI by the PL it was decided that future reduction goals should be based on PL. In the most recent pesticide strategy, covering 2013–2015, the PL reduction target was set at 40% in 2015 compared to 2011, which was chosen as the reference year. The target of 40% was determined based on a study on the expected substitution rates and the related effects on PL, i.e. adoption of IPM tools was not assumed to contribute to the reduction in the short term. Based on sales figures the 40% reduction target was achieved but, due to stockpiling, this was not the case using the pesticide use data uploaded by farmers (data not shown).

One possible use of the information on pesticide load contained in the maps in Fig. 4 is to combine these maps with GIS maps showing the location of specific habitats. For example, the map showing pesticide load for aquatic eco-toxicity of pesticide could be combined with a map of the locations of water ways and lakes, the map illustrating pesticide load for toxicity to bees could be combined with information on the presence of hedgerows and the map showing pesticide load for the risk of leaching to groundwater could be compared to soil classification maps. In this way it would be possible to point out areas or ‘hot spot’, where the risk of adverse effects following pesticide use is particularly high. This information could be used for more targeted monitoring activities or for setting up early warning systems. Alternatively, localized initiatives could be launched incentivising farmers in the ‘hot spots’ to change to less harmful pesticides. Conversely, the information generated by combining pesticide use data with vulnerable ecosystems could also be used to identify what could be classified as ‘cold spots’, where the risk of adverse effects is low and resources used on monitoring could be diverted to a more intensive monitoring in the ‘hot spots’. For example, a comprehensive monitoring programme of groundwater named the Danish Pesticide Leaching Assessment Programme has been in place for several years (Rosenbom et al., 2015). One outcome of the programme is that pesticide contamination of groundwater is not a serious problem in the red-coloured region in the south-eastern part of Denmark (Fig. 4C) and this can be attributed to the heavy clay soils in that region.

Focussing on agronomic rather than environmental aspects Fig. 5 illustrates another potential use of the information available in the database. Pesticide resistance is one of the major challenges that modern farming is facing and a more widely adoption of IPM strategies by farmers will be necessary to delay the rate of appearance of new resistance cases (Barzman et al., 2015). IPM, i.e. combining chemical and non-chemical control methods to reduce the reliability on pesticides, is seen as the most effective strategy to prevent/delay the evolution of pesticide resistance. Due to the current lack of effective non-chemical procedure farmers still rely very much on pesticides and diversity in pesticide modes of actions is therefore regarded as one of the most effective anti-resistance measures in the short term (Beckie and Harker, 2017). ALS inhibitors are among the most resistant-prone herbicide modes of action but due their effectiveness they are widely used in Denmark. Prosulfocarb, on the other hand, is an example of a herbicide where no cases of resistance has been confirmed. From Fig. 5 it is obvious that a high use of ALS-inhibitors in winter wheat is not necessarily correlated with the use of prosulfocarb. The reasons could be different crop rotations, different weed floras etc. but nonetheless the data do suggest that the risk of herbicide resistance becoming an issue in higher in some regions than in others. Furthermore, prosulfocarb is one of the herbicides most severely affected by the new pesticide tax whereas the new tax on ALS inhibitors is lower than the previous value-added tax, which may tempt farmers to increase their use of ALS inhibitors at the expense of compounds like prosulfocarb. One of the characteristics of a pesticide indicator based on inherent properties is that the differences within a chemical group of pesticides with the same mode of action tend to be lower than between chemical groups with different modes of action. Consequently, certain modes of action will be more heavily taxed than others and that could potentially lead to a reduced diversity in the modes of action used by famers and thus a higher risk that pesticide resistance will evolve. A consequence of the Norwegian pesticide tax was that sulfonylurea herbicides became cheaper than other herbicides against broadleaved weed species and this led to a pronounced increase in the their use and widespread problems with sulfonylurea resistance (Netland and Waernhus, 2007).

5. Conclusions
The obligation of farmers to upload information on their pesticide use once a year have provided the Danish authorities with very detailed information on pesticide use eliminating some of the flaws of the previous system based on sales figures such as the effects of stockpiling due to changes in price or products being withdrawn from the market. Furthermore, the data uploaded by the farmers covers the period from 1 August to 31 July, i.e. it reflects the use in the growing season whereas the sales data are reported by calendar year. Combining the pesticide use data with the new pesticide indicator provides very detailed information on the risk of adverse impacts of the use of pesticides and provide the authorities with knowledge that potentially could allow them to single out ‘hot spots’ and targeting pesticide monitoring and surveillance activities. Also valuable agronomic information can be deducted from the data such as a mapping of the use of various modes of actions. Pesticide diversity in terms of modes of action is, however, just one feature of IPM and it is envisaged also to use the pesticide use data to obtain information on crop diversity, the backbone of any IPM strategy. Thus, the collection of pesticide use data is not necessarily just a tool for the competent authorities to monitor pesticide use but could also become a valuable tool to the farming community that could support IPM implementation and delaying the evolution of pesticide resistance, an important achievement in an era with a steadily decreasing number of new pesticide modes of action coming to the market.

This paper discusses the degradation kinetics of mixed (lindane, methyl parathion and carbofuran) pesticides by mixed pesticide enriched cultures (MEC) under various environmental conditions. The bacterial strains isolated from the mixed microbial consortium were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MTCC 9236), Bacillus sp. (MTCC 9235) and Chryseobacterium joostei (MTCC 9237). Batch studies were conducted to estimate the biokinetic parameters like the maximum specific growth rate (μmax), Yield Coefficient (YT), half saturation concentration (Ks) and inhibition concentration (Ki) for individual and mixed pesticide enriched cultures. The cultures enriched in a particular pollutant always showed high growth rate and low inhibition in that particular pollutant compared to MEC. After seven weeks of incubation, mixed pesticide enriched cultures were able to degrade 72% lindane, 95% carbofuran and 100% of methyl parathion in facultative co-metabolic conditions. In aerobic systems, degradation efficiencies of lindane methyl parathion and carbofuran were increased by the addition of 2g L− 1 of dextrose. Though many metabolic compounds of mixed pesticides were observed at different time intervals, none of the metabolites were persistent. Based on the observed metabolites, a degradation pathway was postulated for different pesticides under various environmental conditions."

Though many metabolic compounds of mixed pesticides were observed at different time intervals, none of the metabolites were persistent. Based on the observed metabolites, a degradation pathway was postulated for different pesticides under various environmental conditions.

Introduction
Several pesticides of different chemical composition are currently being used for agricultural purposes all over the world.[ Citation1 ] India is the largest consumer of pesticides in South Asian countries, where the maximum (44.5%) consumption of total pesticides is by the cotton crop.[ Citation2 ] Extensive usage of these pesticides has caused significant pollution of natural water bodies, soils and the atmosphere.[ Citation3 ] Most of the agricultural field uses crop rotation which forces the farmer to use various pesticides. Frequently applied insecticides in modern agriculture mostly belong to organo phosphate (methyl parathion), and carbamate (carbofuran) groups.[ Citation4 ]

Methyl parathion (O−dimethyl O−(4-nitro-phenyl) phosphoro thioate) is used to control chewing and sucking insects such as aphids, boll weevils, and mites in a wide variety of crops, including cereals, fruits, vines, vegetables, ornamentals, cotton and field crops.[ Citation5 ] It is a broad-spectrum non-systemic pesticide that kills pests by stomach poisoning, an acaricide, and has some fumigant action also. The gamma isomer of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), commercially known as lindane, is a highly chlorinated, recalcitrant pesticide. It has been used worldwide as a general broad spectrum insecticide for a variety of purposes like pest control on domestic animals, mosquito control and to kill soil-dwelling and plant-eating insects.[ Citation6 ] Carbofuran (2,3-dihydro-2–2-dimethyl-7-benzofuranyl-methylcarbamate) is a very effective systemic and contact insecticide and nematicide used against a wide range of agricultural pests.[ Citation7 ] The non-biodegradable nature of pesticides made them persist in the environment for a long time and bioaccumulation of these pesticides leads to food and water contamination.[ Citation8 ] DDT (dichloro diphenyl trichloro ethane), endosulfan, lindane, malathion, parathion, etc., can be found in fishes, mammals, water bodies, soil and even in human milk and vegetables.[ Citation9 ] Many treatment technologies like physico-chemical and biological methods are available for the treatment of pesticide in contaminated water, wastewater, soil and sediments.[ Citation10 ] Among these, biological treatment methods seem to be cost-effective, energy-efficient and eco-friendly.

It is reported that several microorganisms under different environmental conditions are capable of degrading many pesticides.[ Citation11 ] Studies on microbial biodegradation of single pesticide in liquid cultures mostly used pure bacterial cultures,[ Citation12 , Citation13 ] mixed native soil microbial population,[ Citation14 , Citation15 ] or sewage sludge under aerobic and anaerobic conditions.[ Citation16 , Citation17 ] A few reports are available on mixed pesticide biodegradation using enriched cultures. Liu et al.[ Citation18 ] studied the degradation potential of methyl parathion and carbofuran by genetically engineered microorganisms (GEMS). Spliid et al.[ Citation19 ] studied the leaching and degradation of 21 pesticides in a full-scale model bio-bed with natural microbial system. Ceron et al.[ Citation20 ] studied in detail about the lindane and methyl parathion degradation and their degradation byproducts. However, not much information is available on bioremediation of mixed pesticide contaminated soil or water by enriched cultures under various environmental conditions. Moreover, the inhibition concentrations of individual pesticide on such cultures were also not quantified. To apply bioremediation as a treatment technology for mixed pesticide-contaminated water or soil, one needs to develop a bio-system which can degrade any pesticide, irrespective of the group it belongs to.

This paper reports on the kinetics of degradation of mixed pesticides (lindane, methyl parathion and carbofuran) by mixed pesticide enriched cultures (MEC). The biokinetic constants for mixed pesticide enriched cultures and individual pesticide enriched cultures were estimated. Based on the identified metabolic byproducts, degradation mechanisms of mixed pesticides were also proposed.

Soil sample collection
Bacterial enrichment study was carried out using contaminated soils collected from the vicinity of lindane, carbofuran and methyl parathion formulation units at Ambattur Industrial Estate, Chennai, India.

Culture medium and acclimatization of microorganisms
The composition of nutrient medium (NM) used for bacterial enrichment was KH2PO4 1.0 g L− 1, K2HPO4 1.0 g L− 1, NH4NO3 1.0 g L− 1, NaCl 1.0 g L− 1, MgSO4·7H2O 0.2 g L− 1, CaCl2 0.02 g L− 1, Fe (SO4)3 0.02 g L− 1 and 1 mL of trace metal solution.[ Citation21 ] The initial acclimatization was carried out in 500 mL sterile Erlenmeyer flasks containing pesticide-contaminated soil mixed with sterile NM to form slurry containing 100 g soil L− 1. The slurry was agitated continuously in an orbital shaker at a temperature of 28 ± 2°C. Mixed pesticides (lindane, methyl parathion and carbofuran), with an initial total concentrations of 25 mg L− 1 of each, were added to 100 mL of NM containing 75 mg L− 1 (dry weight) of enriched microbes. Individual pesticide concentration was increased up to100 mg L− 1 in a stepwise manner (25 mg L− 1 increase in each step) by giving two weeks' time in-between each change in concentration.

Identification of bacterial cultures
The bacterial strains were isolated from the mixed culture by repeated streaking on agar plates. The isolates were separated based on their morphology. Each colony was carefully separated and streaked on fresh agar plates, and this was repeated three times. Thereafter, the cultures were streaked on agar slants and preserved at 4°C for further experiments. The agar slants in triplicate were sent to Microbial Type Culture Collection (MTCC), Institute of Microbial Technology (IMTECH), Chandigarh, India, for microbial identification.

Biodegradation kinetics of mixed pesticides in facultative anaerobic and aerobic conditions
Mixed pesticide (lindane, methyl parathion, and carbofuran) degradation studies were carried out using mixed pesticide enriched cultures (MEC). These degradation studies were conducted at 28 ± 2°C with continuous shaking in aerobic and facultative anaerobic condition with a total pesticide concentration of 50 mg L− 1 (lindane 10 mg L− 1 , methyl parathion 20 mg L− 1 and carbofuran 20 mg L− 1). Nitrogen gas was flushed to selective conical flasks to maintain facultative anaerobic condition and immediately sealed with air-tight septum. Controls containing the same media, without microbes in both the environments were also maintained to check the stability of pesticides in the aqueous systems. Five mL of the sample were collected from each flask at different time intervals and were analyzed for residual concentrations of lindane, methyl parathion, carbofuran and their metabolites. Degradation studies were also conducted in the presence of dextrose (2 g L− 1) as an external carbon source keeping all other experimental conditions the same.

Inhibition studies
Batch experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of initial pesticide concentration on the growth kinetic of various enriched cultures i.e, lindane enriched culture (LEC), methyl parathion enriched culture (MPEC), carbofuran enriched culture (CEC) and mixed pesticide enriched culture (MEC). Different concentrations (0, 10, 20, 50,100,150 and 200 mg L− 1) of lindane, methyl parathion and carbofuran were prepared in 250 mL conical flaks containing 150 mL of NM. Bacterial cells corresponding to an optical density of 0.2 (OD600) of each culture, which was adapted to varying concentrations of (25–100 mg L− 1) lindane, methyl parathion and carbofuran, were inoculated in the medium. The flasks were shaken at 140 rpm and at a temperature of 28°C in the shaking incubator until the experiment was completed. Sterile control experiments were also carried out to quantify the volatility of pesticides in culture medium. All the batch experiments were carried out in duplicate.

Extraction and analytical technique
Homogenized liquid samples (5 mL) were collected at different time intervals and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 6 min and supernatant samples of 4 mL were transferred to 15 mL volumetric tubes and mixed with 4 mL of 1:1 hexane-acetone solution. The average percentage extraction efficiencies of lindane, methyl parathion and carbofuran were 89.4 ± 3.8, 91.8 ± 1.8, and 84.7 ± 2, respectively. Samples of lindane and methyl parathion were analyzed by Perkins Elmer Clarus 500 gas chromatograph (GC) with electron capture detector (ECD) and nitrogen phosphrous detector (NPD) respectively equipped with an auto-sampler, an on-column, split/split less capillary injection system, and with Perkin Elmer (PE)-35 capillary column (30 m × 0.53 mm × 0.5 mm film thickness). Carbofuran samples were analyzed by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Jasco) with UV detector (MD2010 PDA) equipped with packed column of Agilent C18. Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrum (GC-MS, Agilent) was used for separation and identification of intermediate products. The GC–MS was equipped with a HP-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm internal diameter.) with helium as carrier gas (1.0 mL per min) and with a split less injection system. The GC oven temperature was programmed to hold at 100°C for initial 5 min, to increase from 100 to 280°C at a rate of 10°C per min and hold at 280°C for 5 min. The injector and interface temperatures were 220 and 250°C, respectively. Mass spectra were obtained by the electron-impact (EI) mode at 70 eV using the full-scan mode. Residual pesticides were quantified using a calibration curve, which was linear in the range of 1 to 50 mg L− 1. Under these conditions, the retention time of lindane, methyl parathion and carbofuran and their intermediate metabolites detected were: lindane (12.24 min), methyl parathion(11.8 min), carbofuran (5.47 min), pentachlorocyclohexene isomers—PCCH (10.15 min), tetrachlorocyclohexene-TCCH (9.37 min), 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene-1,2,4-TCB (3.24), 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene −1,3,5-TCB (3.12 min), 1,2-dichlorobenzene-1,2-DCB (2.35 min), paranitrophenol-PNP (10.96 min), dimethylthio phosphate-DMTP (7.43 min), amino phenol-(AMP) (9.64 min), and 3-hydroxyl 7-phenol (3.89 min). Pentachloronitrobenzene was used as an internal standard throughout the analysis. The performance of the analytical method was monitored using a surrogate compound (4-Chloro-3-nitrobenzotrifluoride). USEPA[ Citation22 ] surrogate standards were added to all samples, method blanks and calibration.

Mixed pesticide biodegradation in aerobic and facultative anaerobic system
Mixed pesticide degradation studies were conducted in aerobic condition with a pesticide concentration of 50 mg L− 1. Samples were collected at regular intervals and were analyzed for residual concentrations of lindane, methyl parathion and carbofuran, microbial concentration and chemical oxygen demand (COD). The decrease in concentration of pesticides was considered as microbial degradation. Biodegradation efficiencies of methyl parathion, lindane and carbofuran by mixed pesticide enriched cultures (MEC) in aerobic system are presented in Figure 1. DT50 (time required for degradation of 50%) of mixed pesticide varied with respect to pesticide type and concentration. Half lives of methyl parathion, carbofuran and lindane in aerobic condition were 3 days, 21 days and 35 days, respectively. Half lives of methyl parathion, carbofuran and lindane in abiotic conditions are 6.3 days, 47.7 days and 7 months respectively. High half lives of these pesticides were observed at higher concentrations by mixed pesticide-enriched cultures."
,,"Mixed pesticide-enriched cultures have shown very good degradation efficiency with low initial concentrations (10 mg L− 1 and 20 mg L− 1) of lindane and carbofuran. However, 90% of methyl parathion was degraded by MEC within 6 days irrespective of initial methyl parathion concentration (10–50 mg L− 1) employed in the study. Carbofuran degradation by MEC was much faster than lindane, and 72% of degradation was achieved in five weeks. Lindane degradation was not very significant in the first week of incubation. Degradation of lindane started from the second week and maximum degradation (63%) was achieved after seven weeks of incubation. In this study, loss due to dissipation was monitored with the help of control reactors (without bacterial cultures). It was found that the abiotic loss in the system was 10 to 15% in 7 weeks.

Mixed pesticide degradation experiments were also carried out in facultative anaerobic environment with a total mixed pesticide concentration of 50 mg L− 1. Degradation kinetics of these three pesticides is presented in Figure 2. Degradation efficiencies of all the three pesticides were higher in facultative anaerobic condition and maximum of 100% methyl parathion, 86% carbofuran and 72% lindane degradations were observed at 6, 21 and 35 days of incubation, respectively. In aerobic condition, substitutions of halogen as well as nitro and sulfo groups in aromatic rings of lindane, carbofuran and methyl parathion resist the electrophilic attack by oxygenases of aerobic bacteria. However, under anaerobic conditions the enzymatic reactions are effective. This may be one of the reasons for high rate of degradation of mixed pesticide in anaerobic system compared to that in aerobic system by MEC. Reductive dechlorination is a common phenomenon in case of halogenated pesticides including both aliphatic and aromatic compounds.[ Citation23 ] The reductive dechlorination process reduces the degree of chlorination of lindane and makes the products like benzene more accessible to mineralization by aerobic bacteria. Methyl parathion and carbofuran degraded faster compared to lindane. This may be due to the following reasons, i) these two pesticides (methyl parathion and carbofuran) are structurally simple with high water solubility and low adsorption which can easily support microbial growth and leads to higher degradation rates, ii) similar enzyme system i.e., hydrolyses might have developed for the hydrolysis of both methyl parathion and carbofuran biodegradation, and iii) a group of micro organisms could have adopted and developed to degrade side chains of methyl parathion and carbofuran easily.[ Citation24 , Citation25 ]"
,,"COD reduction
The COD of the system increased from 6000 to 8200 after the addition of 2 g L− 1 of dextrose. Utilization of COD by MEC was much higher in the first two weeks. Figure 6 shows the COD utilization pattern of MEC in various reactors. In the first two weeks, though the degradation rates of carbofuran and lindane were less, and the microbial population (measured as optical density) was increased due to the utilization of dextrose as well as organic solvents like ethanol, and acetone present in the reactors. After the addition of dextrose in aerobic condition, there was a significant enhancement of lindane degradation in 1st and 2nd weeks of incubation. A similar trend was observed in aerobic degradation of alpha-HCH by a mixed microbial consortium in minimal media after the addition of one mg mL− 1 of cellulose or sawdust.[ Citation26 ] Availability of large number of microorganisms might have increased the rate of degradation of lindane. However in facultative system, the rate of lindane degradation was significant from the beginning, after the addition of dextrose."

,,"Ions release
In order to confirm the biodegradation, during the study period, concentrations of ions like chloride, nitrate, nitrite, sulphates and phosphates were monitored in various systems. Significant increase in Cl−concentration was observed in all the reactors (Fig. 12) during lindane degradation. Chloride concentrations were in well agreement with the percentage degradation of lindane in all the reactors. Chloride release was faster in facultative anaerobic systems compared to aerobic ones. In aerobic systems, initially there was a lag phase with respect to chloride release. However, with respect to time, the rate of release increased and became almost equal to the facultative system. The concentrations of other ions like nitrate, nitrite, sulphates and phosphates were not significant in any system, though there was a slight change in concentrations with time. Most of these ions except chlorides might have utilized the cells for their growth. This may be the reason for insignificant changes in the concentrations of other ions."

"Pesticides are chemical substances used to prevent, destroy, or control plant and a	nimal pests. They can be classified according to their che	""mical family (organochlorines", organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids, dipyridyl compounds," and ino""	""rganic salts).Citation1 Pesticides can cause toxicity and harm in humans if the level of exposure is sufficiently high.Citation2",Citation3 It has been estimated that annually there are 385 million cases of unintentional, acute pesticide poisoning worldwide, including around 11,"000 fatalities.Citation4""						",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Agricultural populations exposed to pesticides have been reported to suffer various	""health problems", mainly neurological disorders," and respi""	""ratory", reproductive, endocrinological, and dermal problems.Citation5–7 For example," organophosphorus""	""compounds inhibit enzymes like acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and neuropathy target esterase (NTE)Citation8",Citation9; this results in the accumulation of acetylcholine (ACh) and phosphatidylcholine, respectively which may lead to acute or intermediate poisoning due to the cholinergic effect and organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP).Citation9,"Citation10""						",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The main manifestations of acute intoxication are excessive overstimulation of musc	""arinic and nicotinic cholinergic receptors"," which can lead""	""to changes in consciousness", muscle weakness, and excessive secretory activity.Citation11,"Citation12""	""In addition"," organophosphate and carbamate exposure is associated with neurodegenerative diseases.Citation13–15""						",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Given the wide range of pesticide exposure on physiological and cognitive functions	""",Citation16,"Citation17 one possible sensitive diagnostic t""	""est to quantify the signs and symptoms of neurotoxicity"," is the evaluation of vision and visual functi""	""on", which previous studies have shown to be highly susceptible to neurotoxic damage.Citation18–20 A candidate measure is the pupil size,Citation21–23 which has experimentally shown reversible changes due to exposure to organophosphorus.Citation24–26 Importantly, changes in pupil size have occurred without other overt signs of toxicity and suggest that miosis may be an early sign of pesticide exposure.Citation22,"Citation27""						",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pupillary miosis is the function of the sphincter of the pupil, which is innervated	""by parasympathetic fibres. At the same time"," mydriasis is""	""the function of the dilator pupillae and is controlled by sympathetic fibres.Citation22","Citation28 In""	""this way", the pupil size reflects the function of the autonomic nervous system," which regulates the antagonistic actions of the iris sphincter and the dilator muscles of the eye and controls the amount of light entering the eye.Citation29""						",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Synaptic transmission in the neural pathways regulating pupil size involves AChE, w	""hich", as mentioned," is inhibited by pesticide-related orga""	nophosphates.Citation8 Organophosphates in the eye can cause significant AChE inhibition and muscarini	""c receptor downregulation which may lead to abnormal presentations of pupil size", particularly miosis.Citation27,Citation30 Indeed, most visual and ocular signs and symptoms of acute organophosphate poisoning are reflected in different types of muscarinic manifestations (generally the parasympathetic system), such as pupillary contraction (miosis)," stimulation of the different endings of the lacrimal gland and blurred vision (due to accommodation).Citation30 The miotic effect may be reduced after repeated exposure to organophosphates because of the development of tolerance to cholinergic agonists and desensitisation of muscarinic AChE receptors on the pupillary sphincter.Citation31""						",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Accordingly, miosis may be a potential marker for pesticide agents in the body.Cita	""tion22","Citation27 Given the strong action of the pesticide""	""on the neuronal system that supports miosis"," the assessment of pupil size in individuals exposed to p""	""esticides may provide a sensitive and efficient indication of neurotoxicity"," as its measurement is non-invasive fast and easy to perform.""

"The present study aimed to establish whether exposure to occupational levels of pes	ticides in agricultural workers is associated with altered	""pupil sizes", particularly signs of miosis.

"Recent research (conducted on farm workers) has shown that regular exposure to pest	icides can lead to neurotoxicity resulting in deficits in	""visual function", particularly in contrast and colour perception," and elevated inflammatory markers (Su""	bstance p) in tears.Citation33 This finding suggests that measuring changes in vision may be a useful way of quantifying the impact on the brain.

Other European countries outside the EU are also pursuing similar goals, such as Switzerland, which has set a goal of reducing the risks of pesticide use to the environment by 50% by 2027 (Finger, 2021). While the strategic goals are clear, their translation into policies and their implementation in agricultural practices are highly debated. In particular, the potential trade-offs are currently the subject of public and political debate (e.g., Candel et al., 2023; Schneider et al.," 2023).""						",,,,,,,,,,

"2 HOW TO ACHIEVE PESTICIDE RISK REDUCTION TARGETS									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To achieve the pesticide risk reduction targets, while maintaining yield levels, fu	ndamental changes to current agricultural practices along	""the efficiency-substitution-conversion gradient are required (Finger", 2021). For example," the efficien""	""cy of pesticide use can be increased using precision farming technologies. Pesticides can also be replaced by non-chemical or low-risk pesticide strategies. For example", through biological pest control or by replacing herbicides with mechanical weed control. Finally, cropping systems need to be redesigned to reduce pest pressure. This will reduce the need for pest control. For example, through preventative measures," resistant varieties and changes to crop rotations.""						",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3 STRICTER PESTICIDE POLICIES BRING SOCIAL BENEFITS AND COSTS									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Reducing pesticide risks implies lower external costs of the agricultural sector an	d contributes to the achievement of many agri-environmenta	""l policy objectives and the Sustainable Development Goals (Schneider et al.", 2023). In particular," it""	""reduces pollution of ecosystems (e.g.", water bodies), reduces biodiversity loss and reduces impacts on human health (Möhring et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2021). Reduced pesticide use can also have positive long-term effects on agricultural productivity, for example, through improved soil biodiversity and pollination services (Schneider et al., 2023). However, there may also be negative indirect effects on the environment. For example, if reduced pesticide use makes it more difficult to implement soil conservation measures (Wesseler," 2022).""						",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There are concerns that the transition to low pesticide risk practices may have an	""impact on domestic food production"," especially in the shor""	""t term. In particular"," reducing pesticide use in the absence of suitable and effective alternatives ma""	""y reduce productivity and yield levels. For example", Barreiro-Hurle et al. (2021) assumed that the implementation of EU pesticide targets would lead to an overall reduction in crop yields of 10%. Expected yield reductions tend to be highly crop- and region-specific. For the same policy objective, Bremmer et al. (2021) found that for some crops and regions there are no yield losses (e.g., for cereals in Finland), while for others there are large yield losses of up to 30% (e.g., for grapes and olives in France and Italy). Yield volatility may also increase, for example, due to greater susceptibility to pest infestation. The transition to a low pesticide risk future may also imply long-term adjustments in what is produced, where, and how. For example, land use may gradually shift away from crops that currently rely heavily on pesticide use. Systematic changes in land use and crop yields and greater variability in production could have an impact on European self-sufficiency in different crops, which is a critical point of discussion in policy negotiations (Schneider et al.," 2023).""						",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stricter pesticide policies can also affect food prices. Lower crop yields can lead	""to lower supply and therefore higher prices. However"," thi""	""s effect is very crop and country specific. For example"," Bremmer et al. (2021) found only a small pote""	""ntial impact on cereal prices at the European level (e.g.", for wheat), while prices for specific crops (e.g., wine and olives) would increase. The impact of reduced pesticide use on the intrinsic and extrinsic quality of crops is also important for price effects. For example, reduced pesticide use may reduce extrinsic product quality (e.g., the appearance of dessert apples) and thus lead to price reductions (Bremmer et al., 2021). On the other hand, consumers may have a higher willingness to pay for products produced with lower pesticide use (i.e., higher intrinsic product quality), potentially leading to new labels and opportunities for price premiums (Grebitus & Van Loo," 2022).""						",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4 STRICTER PESTICIDE POLICIES ARE AFFECTING FARMS									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lower and more volatile yields and higher costs due to stricter pesticide policies	""reduce the economic viability of farms"," ceteris paribus. H""	""owever", the expected impact of stricter pesticide policies on these aspects is not clear. For example,"	while the costs of purchasing and applying pesticides may decrease", the costs of alternative strategies (e.g., mechanical weed control) may increase. Stricter pesticide policies may also have an impact on farm labor, both by changing the demand for labor (e.g., if alternative strategies require more working hours) and by changing the skills required of workers (e.g., if new technologies are used). Both price premiums and agri-environmental schemes can compensate farmers for adopting low pesticide use practices and the associated changes in yields, costs, and risks. For example, Germany and Switzerland have introduced agri-environmental schemes that compensate farmers for reducing or avoiding pesticide use (Mack et al., 2023; Runge et al., 2022). In view of all these factors, the overall impact on farm incomes is unclear and is likely to be farm-specific. In regions and for crops where it is easy to reduce pesticide use, farmers may benefit from higher prices and additional government payments without facing large yield losses and cost increases. In other regions and crops, however, farmers could experience lower yields and higher costs, especially those with less adaptable cropping systems, such as perennial crops. Overall, then," we expect that stricter pesticide policies could increase income inequality in agriculture if these policies did not take into account the crop- and region-specific context.""						",,,,,,
"									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5 THE POTENTIAL IMPACT GOES WELL BEYOND EUROPE									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"European agriculture is not isolated, and the transition to lower pesticide risk pr	oduction systems has implications for agricultural and foo	""d systems worldwide. For example"," introducing stricter pesticide policies in Europe may lead to shifts""	""in trade flows. For example", Bremmer et al. (2021) note a potential increase in net imports into Europe for crops such as rapeseed and citrus fruits, while net exports for tomatoes, olives, and wine will decrease. Changes in trade flows also risk shifting environmental impacts from Europe to other parts of the world, that is, leakage (Tang et al., 2022). More specifically, if lower footprints in Europe mean lower productivity that must be compensated by higher imports, this may increase the intensity of production and land use in other parts of the world, leading to a shift in environmental and human health impacts (Barreiro-Hurle et al., 2021). If Europe requires more imports of certain crops, some regions outside Europe may benefit economically from increased export opportunities, but an overall decline in agricultural production may contribute to higher global food prices, threatening global food security (Wesseler, 2022). In addition, the approaches to low pesticide production emerging in Europe may become the benchmark for imports and future trade agreements (e.g., as new sustainability standards), with potentially major implications for trading partners (Beckman et al., 2020). Finally, the innovation triggered by European pesticide policy may also spill over globally. An ambitious pesticide policy can trigger the development and widespread use of new low- and pesticide-free production systems and new technologies. This will reduce the costs and uncertainties associated with such a transition, making it easier for other countries to follow suit. In this sense, Candel et al. (2023, p. 272) state that Europe can become “a role model for the transition towards low-pesticide-risk futures, paving the way for other countries to meet goals defined in the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework”. Europe could thus set in motion a global momentum for the much-needed transition to more sustainable agricultural practices. An open question, however," is whether and how new technologies and policies can be transferred from Europe to other regions.""						"

"6 OPEN QUESTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS RESEARCH									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We summarize here open questions as well as key avenues for future agricultural eco	""nomic research to support practitioners", industry," and pol""	icy makers in the transition to low pesticide agricultural systems.							",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Several of the above impacts on yields, costs, and risks, as well as the implicatio	""ns for farmer decision making and markets"," are not well un""	""derstood", are highly uncertain," and thus require further analysis. Quantifying the impacts of transiti""	""oning to currently unknown production systems at large scales with heterogeneous impacts at the farm level also requires new research approaches", such as combining expert knowledge with agent-based bioeconomic modeling approaches (Mack et al.," 2023). There is also a need for the coherent consideration of stricter pesticide policies and the emergence of new low- and no-pesticide production systems and standards on global trade dynamics and policies.""						",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Better quantification of the environmental and human health benefits of stricter pe	sticide policies is needed. This includes an assessment of	the costs of not adopting stricter pesticide policies right now. Agricultural economic research can p	""rovide better approaches to quantify and value the environmental and human health impacts"," ecosystem services and disservices associated with crop protection.""						",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition, the long-term effects, dynamics, and feedback loops between environmen	""tal", agricultural," and economic systems are not well under""	""stood. For example"," we do not know how farmers adjust land use and production systems over the long te""	""rm to avoid negative impacts on yields", costs and labor requirements. We also lack long-term and causal evidence on the adoption of low pesticide risk practices and their impact on productivity, yields and economic viability. As a result, the relevant dynamics are not included in the economic models currently used. In this sense, reduced reliance on pesticides may contribute to higher income risks and greater income inequality. Although this has important implications for agricultural and policy decision-making, empirical evidence is still largely lacking," and new research approaches are needed.""						",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Farmers need effective and economically viable alternatives to pesticides, especial	ly for those pesticides that pose high risks to the enviro	""nment and human health. At the same time"," these alternatives should not reduce crop yields or increase""	""food prices and should be socially acceptable. In addition", these alternatives need to be implemented quickly to meet the ambitious short-term targets. In reality, however, these alternatives are often not yet attractive to farmers, are associated with major uncertainties, and face political obstacles. Agricultural economic research shall therefore address the economic and political aspects of alternatives to pesticide use. This may include new farming systems as well as digital innovations such as precision agriculture, robots, and the use of digital technologies to redesign future agricultural landscapes (Möhring et al., 2020). It may also include new production systems based on agroecological crop protection and the use of new breeding technologies to create pest-resistant varieties (Ewert et al.," 2023).""						",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Finally, agricultural economic research should support the development and evaluati	""on of innovative policies. For example"," measures to suppor""	""t the reduction of pesticide use", the introduction of alternative strategies," and the reduction of tra""	""de-offs between pesticide use and other policy objectives. Innovative instruments could include", for example, the taxation of pesticides according to pesticide risks (Nielsen et al., 2023) and the use of performance-based payment schemes to prevent pollution of water and ecosystems and to achieve biodiversity objectives in relation to crop protection. The latter may require new policies at the landscape level, extending beyond individual farms. In contrast to pesticide bans, such innovative measures give farmers the freedom and flexibility to reduce pesticide risks in the most cost-effective way and provide incentives to shift from high-risk to low-risk production systems. In addition, research is needed on new policy approaches to ensure that inequalities are reduced, that is, that the losers of stricter pesticide policies, for example, certain farms and consumers," are compensated.""

"Pest species pose a significant threat to the agricultural industry as they can neg	atively impact crop productivity and result in potential f	inancial losses due to damage. This research aims to address agricultural challenges in the local area	""and improve the efficiency of pesticide application. A solar-powered", remote-controlled, semi-automated knapsack sprayer vehicle has been developed to address this issue.  It operates using a 100 AH battery that is charged by four 30W solar panels connected in tandem to produce 120 W, providing power to the motors and pump. The vehicle uses a 12 V hub motor to drive the back and steer the front and is equipped with a 12 V window regulator/wiper motor. The vehicle is controlled by a remote control and an HC-05 transmitter and receiver, programmed with an ATMEGA32A linked to a relay board. The vehicle utilizes a 116 psi ? 799.8 kPa pump for the sprayer. Results indicate that as the feed pressure increases, the flow rate steadily rises and reaches 4 L per minute at the 799.8 kPa pump. With a pump spray rate of 5 L per minute when increased and a pesticide tank capacity of 20 L, the vehicle can spray for a total of 4 min and cover 159 m. Employing a remote control reduces the need for manual labour, making pesticide spraying more consistent, efficient," and productive.

"Agriculture success in Nigeria not only meets the food demands of the rising popula	tion but also provides raw materials to industry and helps	""other sectors prosper. As a result", to achieve food security," industrial and agricultural operations""	must complement rather than oppose each other. Some of the problems the agriculture sector faces today can be solved by employing automated procedures in the field [1].						",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Pests have plagued humanity for at least 10,000 years. They are organisms such as i	""nsects", rodents, bacteria, fungi," and viruses that harm ou""	r way of life. The species have long been regarded as a major source of concern in the agricultural se	""ctor", not only for their negative effects on crop production and potential revenue loss due to damage but also for the serious damage they can cause to farming equipment, machinery, and even property if left untreated. The discovery of sulfur dusting was used in Mesopotamia by the fifteenth century to eradicate crop pests. Later, nicotine sulfate was discovered in tobacco leaves and employed as a pesticide. In the nineteenth century, tropical crop roots were introduced [2]. Pesticides are either natural or organic (derived from plants) or synthetic and inorganic (copper, sulphur) compounds used to control, repel," and destroy pests to decrease their damaging impact on property and crops [3].""						",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pesticides are thus employed in a wide range of industries, including crops, animal	""farming", forestry, home gardening, horticulture," houses a""	""nd hospitals"," and even recreational places. They are extremely important not only in farming but also""	""in everyday life. The employment of a unique mechanical instrument known as a """"""""sprayer"""""""" is a frequent method of delivery", particularly in the agriculture industry [4]. The mechanism of a sprayer consists of a tank, a pump, and a nozzle. Sprayers turn a liquid chemical mixture (in this case," a pesticide formulation) into droplets whose size can be controlled by the nozzle head [5].""						",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Energy derived from renewable resources is rechargeable. Wind, rain, tides, sunligh	""t"," and other natural phenomena are examples of renewable e""	nergy [6]. The sun is a fantastic renewable energy source that can rekindle life on Earth and give its	""inhabitants sustainable energy. Its energy can be transformed into electricity using solar Photovoltaic (PV) modules that comprise a solar panel. The solar panel uses solar radiation to store electric energy or to charge batteries. The battery then powers the DC pump", which sprays the insecticides [7]. A sprayer sprays liquid from a pressurized tank carried at the back of the person using a hand-held nozzle. Knapsack sprayers help apply pesticides to specific areas [8,9,10]. They are used in homes, gardens, schools, farms, and public parks. Pests in agriculture include insects, mites, plant diseases, etc. If left unchecked, some pests are persistent and can result in significant and long-lasting economic loss, whereas others only do so occasionally when the environment is disturbed. Others relocate to a different geographic region due to various environmental variables. Pesticides include insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, rodenticides, and antimicrobials. It can be applied in preventative mode before infestation or attack, or in a curative mode, where broad-spectrum pesticides are sprayed to fast eradicate or reduce insect populations. In Europe," the type used for non-agricultural uses is known as biocides [11].""						",,,,,,,
"									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On occasion, pesticides are described in terms of their modes of action. For instan	""ce"," systemic types are absorbed in the root and travel thr""	""oughout the plant's tissue"," whereas fumigants are administered to the soil as gases to """"""""sterilize"""""""" i""	""t. They can be made as a water or oil solution or in concentrations that can be emulsified. Specific equipment is frequently needed to deliver insecticides effectively and efficiently [12] which can be automated by utilizing many technological advancements to improve and automate various farming activities to increase production. This device was created to help farmers overcome these difficulties. Automated robots could assist us in coming up with a solution for the problem that has been raised [13]. Hopkins asserts that technology enables a farm to grow without paying more for labour. The system is intended to be as modular as possible"," enabling the development and modification of any individual roles [14].""						",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In spraying techniques, the insecticide and water are combined in the correct ratio	s to create the spray solution. Spraying the diluted mixtu	re uses hydraulic nozzles. Spraying is frequently done to the point where the foliage is dripping with	""it. This method makes heavy use of spray liquid. There are many different high-volume sprayers available. Most high-volume sprayers employ a pump to pressurize the spray liquid and transfer it to the hydraulic nozzle", dividing it into spray droplets and dispersing the spray. High-volume sprayers can be driven manually or electronically [15,16,"17].""						",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Recently, some spray vehicles were developed to combat the effects of pests on agri	cultural produce to increase productivity. A Robot sprayer	was designed and implemented by Ravi et al. to spray pesticides using IOT through a remote mobile app	"". It was intended as a prototype of a lesser volume that could not contain 1 L of pesticide giving it much time to cover a wide range of kilometres [18]. Aishwarya and his colleagues proposed a robotic prototype of a pesticide-spraying vehicle that can reduce human efforts to enhance an efficient and productive agricultural practice in India to detect pests", and spray pesticides and fertilizer using a cost-less device [19]. Fernando and Ricardo designed a robot agriculture vehicle to carry out an agricultural task in the field [20]. The effects of pests in the banana fields always affect the agricultural output, which made Raghuram et al. design and develop an intelligent vehicle for spraying pesticides thereby reducing the high cost of labourers through automation [21]. Kassim et al. designed and developed an autonomous spraying robot for a fertigation farm [22]. Shaw and others designed and developed pest, fertilizer, and disinfectant spraying drones to reduce cost, time," and labour [23].""						",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This research aims to address agricultural challenges in the local area and improve	the efficiency of pesticide application.

"Remote-controlled vehicles allow farmers to operate the pesticide sprayer from a sa	""fe distance"," reducing their direct exposure to potentially""	""harmful chemicals.

The controller prevents the battery from being overcharged by solar modules and over-discharged by loads and is only for off-grid solar systems, in particular, solar lighting systems; which have the following specifications: Maximum PV Voltage: 50 V, Maximum PV Input Power: 260 W (12 V), 520 W (24 V), Rated Voltage: 12 V/24 V, Rated Current: 20 A," Weight: 1 kg.""

"The charge controller is the only device linked to the panels since it controls the	""output voltage of the panels to around 14 V"," which is req""	uired to charge the battery if the panels produce a greater voltage that could harm the battery. The s	""olar sprayer will be fully charged within two hours if the environment's ambient temperature is up to 35 degrees Cenci’s. The battery has a special separator that enhances its internal performance and specification with these specifications: rated capacity (Amp-Hour) is 100AH (Amp-Hour)", 12 V Output Voltage, 25 kg weight, and 30.0 A of initial current. The cycle use is 14.4–14.7 V (25 C) and the standby use is 13.5–13.8 V (25C). The DC hub motor speed is 2800 rpm, 250 watts of output power, and 12 V. The motor speed was lowered to 284 rpm using a gear reduction ratio of 9.87:1. The actual output speed when the gear is lowered is 2800 rpm/9.87, or 283.69 ~ 284 rpm. Chain sprockets further limit the speed to 25 rpm by utilizing a ratio of 11.42:1. The DC window regulator motor used for steering was discovered to perform flawlessly after extensive study and concept testing on the steering system of land vehicles. Simply changing the battery's polarity allowed it to move in both directions. It moved the wheels at the proper speed and had enough power to support the entire weight with 2.5 kg for the motor and 12 V.

The nozzles utilized in this project are low-flow mist nozzles. An analysis of one such nozzle revealed a circular and cone-like flow pattern", discharging droplets of 45 microns. The nozzle's flow rate is approximately 1.20 L per hour at full pressure. Consequently, this results in a total fluid consumption (in this case, pesticide) of around 4.80 L per hour. The coverage achieved by one nozzle is 1.6 m," leading to a total spread length of 6.4 m that the system can cover.""						",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This signified a relationship between the feed pressure and flow rate over time. As the feed pressure increases, the flow rate rises continuously and reaches 4 L/min at the 116-psi ? 799.8 kPa pump. The 4 L/min flow rate is for four nozzles at the 799.8 kPa pressure. As the pressure increases the feed," water can overcome any hindrances to flow and move faster.""						",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The nozzle arrangement can be changed to accommodate higher and lower crops. This technology eliminates the requirement for manual labour. The spraying is reliable and efficient; it can be done consistently and effectively thereby enhancing productivity and boosting cost.

"Abstract

Risk assessment of pesticide impacts on remote ecosystems makes use of model-estimated degradation in air. Recent studies suggest these degradation rates to be overestimated, questioning current pesticide regulation. Here, we investigated the concentrations of 76 pesticides in Europe at 29 rural, coastal, mountain, and polar sites during the agricultural application season. Overall, 58 pesticides were observed in the European atmosphere. Low spatial variation of 7 pesticides suggests continental-scale atmospheric dispersal. Based on concentrations in free tropospheric air and at Arctic sites, 22 pesticides were identified to be prone to long-range atmospheric transport, which included 15 substances approved for agricultural use in Europe and 7 banned ones. Comparison between concentrations at remote sites and those found at pesticide source areas suggests long atmospheric lifetimes of atrazine, cyprodinil, spiroxamine, tebuconazole, terbuthylazine, and thiacloprid. In general, our findings suggest that atmospheric transport and persistence of pesticides have been underestimated and that their risk assessment needs to be improved.

Synopsis
Atmospheric pesticide presence and levels in remote areas mirror those in continental Europe, calling into question the current risk assessment assumptions related to degradation in air.

Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Pesticides are synthetic chemicals used for their toxic effects. (1) Their agricultural use has significantly increased globally from 2.4 million tons in 1990 to 4.1 million tons in 2020. (2,3) Chemicals authorized for pesticidal use vary widely in their chemical structures and physicochemical properties. (4,5) Since the 1960s, growing environmental and health concerns have led to usage restrictions of the previously dominant organochlorine pesticides, to their substitution by more biodegradable ones, and, where possible, to less intensive application. (6) Because of the toxicity of pesticides and their metabolites to nontarget organisms, environmental exposure to pesticides is a concern. (7,8) Upon bioaccumulation and biomagnification, lipophilic pesticides (with an octanol–water partition coefficient KOW of > 105) may reach effect levels in top predators and humans. (9?11)
Most pesticides are semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs). (10) They enter the atmosphere upon application via direct emission from spray drift, through wind erosion of soil particles containing pesticides, and via volatilization from soil, vegetation, or water surfaces. (3,12?14) Currently used pesticides have been found in rural air (15?17) and ecosystems (18,19) but have also been observed far from the sources, at high mountains, (20) in the marine boundary layer, (21,22) and in the Arctic. (10,23,24) Such observations have been sporadic because unlike organochlorine pesticides, these pesticides are rarely included in air-monitoring programs (in Europe apart from France and Sweden (25)).
Evidence for long-range transport to remote areas is one of the criteria for a chemical to be considered a persistent organic pollutant (POP). (26,27) Unlike organochlorine pesticides (e.g., DDT, lindane) which are classified as POPs, it has been largely considered that the new generation of pesticides, currently in use globally, are not prone to long-range atmospheric transport (LRAT) due to their short atmospheric half-lives (i.e., <2 days). (27) The atmospheric lifetime of SVOCs is determined by gas/particle partitioning and their reactivity in the gaseous and particulate phases and, if degradation is resisted in Earth surface compartments, might be enhanced by multiple cycles of deposition and revolatilization (grasshopper effect). (28,29) However, gas/particle partitioning of currently used pesticides is incompletely understood and experimental data for reactions with atmospheric oxidants are available for only few substances. (30?35) Without such data, degradability in air is often assessed based on model-estimated reactivity with the hydroxyl (OH) radical in the homogeneous gas phase. (36) However, recent findings have shown the presence of pesticides with theoretical persistence in air below the LRAT potential threshold also in remote areas. (22?24) This questions the accuracy of the pesticide risk assessment in Europe to protect the atmospheric environment and remote ecosystems, which considers only the atmospheric half-life, for which only the modeled reactivity with the OH radical in the gas phase is considered.
Here, taking advantage of air-monitoring infrastructures, we present the continental-scale distributions of 76 pesticides in the atmosphere over Europe. To this end, 77 particulate and 17 gas-phase samples were collected during the main pesticide application period in spring 2020 at 29 rural, coastal, mountain, and polar sites across Europe and the European Arctic (Figure S1 and Table S1).

Sampling Sites
The contributing 29 sampling sites (Table S1) are observational platforms of the Aerosol, Clouds and Trace Gases Research Infrastructure (ACTRIS, www.actris.eu/) and/or the Co-operative Programme for Monitoring and Evaluation of the Long-range Transmission of Air Pollutants in Europe (EMEP, www.emep.int/) and have long-term expertise with atmospheric aerosol particle and trace gas sampling. These 29 sampling sites are located in 17 different European countries and in the European Arctic (Figure S1) and were classified as rural (n = 16), coastal (n = 4), mountain (n = 6), and polar (n = 3) based on their geographical characteristics and/or land use analysis. Indeed, the mountain and polar sites were defined based on their geographical characteristics with, respectively, an altitude of >2000 m a.s.l. and a latitude of >67°N. In the second step, the type of land use surrounding each sampling site (10 km radius) was characterized using the CORINE Land Cover 2018 for all sites except the Zeppelin Observatory for which the Global Land Cover 2000 was used (Table S2). (37) To this end, the many categories available from these databases were grouped into more relevant ones considering the aim of this study (Table S3). The coastal sites were defined as those having >35% of their surrounding areas (10 km radius) as water bodies, while for rural sites, it was >60% of agricultural land, forest and shrub, and/or herbaceous vegetation associations. In addition, the rural sites were subcategorized as agricultural-adjacent (A.) or nonagricultural-adjacent (N.A.) if their share of agricultural land in their surrounding area was above or below 45%, respectively.
Sampling
Sampling took place simultaneously at all 29 sites in the main pesticide application season in spring 2020 during three 48 h sampling periods (namely, 28–30/04, 12–14/05, and 26–28/05). Sampling was performed with active air samplers (low or high volume, based on on-site availability, Table S1). Due to Covid-19 epidemic-related restrictions in some countries, only 22 sites collected samples during all three sampling periods, while 4 and 3 sites collected samples during 2 and 1 sampling period, respectively (Table S1).
All sites collected the particulate phase on quartz fiber filters (QFF, QM-A, Whatman, U.K.), preferentially (but not always) with a PM10 inlet, as CUPs have previously been found in both the fine and coarse particles. (15) In addition, six sites (ADA, BKO, KOS, SBO, UFS, and ZPO) sampled also the gaseous phase on a sandwich sorbent (i.e., PUF/XAD2/PUF sandwich), consisting of a polyurethane foam plug (PUF, Molitan a.s., Czech Republic, density 0.030 g cm–3, 5 cm depth, diameter of 5.5/11 cm for the low/high-volume air sampler), a layer of XAD resin (Supelpak-2, Supelco), and another PUF plug, separated by cotton wool. This sandwich configuration has been shown to be the most efficient for the collection of gaseous pesticides. (38) Prior to sampling, PUFs and XAD2 were precleaned via Soxhlet extraction with acetone for 8 h, followed by 8 h of extraction in methanol. All sampling media were provided by RECETOX and shipped to the sites. In total, 77 samples and 35 field blank samples were collected (i.e., 77 QFFs and 17 PUF/XAD2/PUF sandwiches) and kept in the freezer at ?18 °C until extraction.
Sample Preparation, Analysis, and QAQC
All samples underwent spiking with labeled standards (Table S4) before extraction. The extraction process involved using an automatic extractor (Büchi Extraction System, B-811, Switzerland) with 5 mM ammonium acetate in methanol. The extraction process consisted of 1 h of warm Soxhlet, followed by 1 h of solvent rinsing, and a concentration step to 1 mL using nitrogen. After centrifugation for 10 min (12,000 G, Z-36 HK, Hermle Labortechnik, Germany) within polypropylene tubes (Corning Costar Spin-X), the extracts were filtered (cellulose acetate membrane and 0.22 ?m pore size) and further concentrated to 0.5 mL under nitrogen.
Postextraction, the samples were divided into three 100 ?L aliquots, each undergoing a different analysis. The three analyses allowed the quantification of 76 pesticides (35 herbicides, 22 insecticides, and 19 fungicides) (Table S5). Among these pesticides, 40 are approved for agricultural use in Europe, 22 are among the most globally used pesticides, 34 are characterized as priority active ingredients to be monitored in France, 13 are highly hazardous pesticides, and 25 are high-risk pesticides.
To ensure quality assurance, field blanks were analyzed alongside air samples collected. Blank levels of most individual analytes were generally below or low (Tables S6 and S7). Procedural recoveries were assessed by spiking sampling media with native standards and their corresponding isotopic-labeled standards, followed by processing as per sample. Most procedural recoveries fell within the range of 60–120% with standard deviations below 20%, except for a few exceptions.

Air Mass Origin
The Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART (39) was used to identify the potential source regions by calculating the residence times in the surface layer of air sampled.
The meteorological data used (0.5 and 1° and 3 h horizontal and temporal resolutions, 137 vertical levels) were obtained from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (www.ecmwf.int, last access: 21/06/2022). For each simulation, 100,000 particles were continuously released from the sites at the ground level for the polar sites and at altitudes ranging 190–210 m agl for mountain sites and were followed for 30 and 10 days backward in time at polar sites and mountain sites, respectively (Figures S2–S5).
Advection to Mountain Sites
For the six high-mountain sites, the advection was characterized using various combinations of on-site tracer measurements and meteorological data and modeling. For all mountain sites, the conclusions on the planetary boundary layer (PBL) influence on the sampled air were based on the site-specific experiences (Table S8).
At CPK, regional chemistry-transport modeling data (ALADIN model, 2 km × 2 km horizontal resolution) (40) were used to judge whether the sampled air was within the free troposphere (FT) or within the PBL. The CPK site was within the FT during most of the sampling time. However, due to short-term (<1 h) liftings of the inversion (which occurred 2, 10, and 2 times during the sampling periods 1, 2, and 3, respectively), PBL air was mixed into all three air samples.
The model terrain is ca. 500 m below the true altitude. Moreover, due to resolution limitations of the model, in particular, in complex terrain, upslope movement of air from valleys will be systematically underestimated. For HAC, the on-site gaseous (i.e., CO, CO2) and aerosol tracer measurements, meteorological parameters, and planetary boundary layer height (obtained from ECMWF) were used. (41?43) Air collected during period 2 represented almost exclusively the FT. It was heavily affected by Sahara dust long-range transport. Sampling period 3 was characterized by relatively low and stable concentrations of specific tracers (i.e., aerosol absorption and particle number concentration), but the station was mostly in clouds, indicating conditions characteristic of the interface between FT and PBL. PBL influence on air collected cannot be excluded. No sample was collected during period 1. For JFJ, on-site Rn measurements (44) and data from a ceilometer, obtained at the foot of the site (measured at Kleine Scheidegg, altitude difference of 1510 m; 6 km direct distance from JFJ), (45) were used to judge free tropospheric vs boundary layer air. JFJ was above the planetary boundary layer during short periods in all three sampling periods. The samples represent mixed FT and PBL air. At PDM, the analysis of 222Rn measurements (?-detection) suggested mixed FT and PBL air during sampling period 3. No samples were collected during periods 1 and 2. For SBO, data from a ceilometer (Vaisala CL51) (46) obtained at the foot of the site (measured at Kolm-Saigurn, altitude difference of 1466 m; 5 km direct distance from SBO) were used to judge on FT vs PBL air. Heights for measuring periods with signals under the detection limit, which occurred during nighttime, were interpolated. The derived heights of the PBL were below SBO during all three sampling periods. No sample was collected during period 1. At UFS, the 222Rn measurements (?-detection) (47) suggested FT air with some PBL influence during the sampling periods 1 and 2 and almost exclusively FT air during sampling period 3. The attribution is supported by on-site measurements of humidity and other meteorological parameters. (48) In addition, advection and possible collection of FT air were investigated for two other elevated sites, i.e., RIG (Switzerland, 1031 m a.s.l.) and ZPO (Svalbard, 474 m a.s.l.). In situ and ceilometer data, (49) respectively, besides others, indicated that at both sites, the air collected during the three sampling periods was PBL air or PBL with little FT air mixed in.
Data Analysis
All the statistical analysis was performed using software GraphPad Prism (v9.0.0). For these analyses, when the concentration of a compound was lower than that of iLOD, iLOQ, or LOQb, these values were not taken into account. Substitutions of values below LOQ by LOQ/2 were used to determine the relative standard deviation (Table 1).

European Distribution of Atmospheric Pesticides
Out of the 76 pesticides targeted, 58 were found in the atmosphere, including the European Arctic. In the atmospheric particulate phase, 51, 38, 24, and 6 pesticides were found at rural, coastal, mountain, and polar sites, respectively (Figures S6–S8). Overall, the number of particulate pesticides decreases with latitude and increases with the proximity to agricultural fields (Figure 1). Among these 58 pesticides present in European air, about 50% were rarely found (1–5 sites), while around 20% were quantified in more than half of the sites investigated (Table S9).
Figure 1

Figure 1. Number of pesticides quantified in the particulate phase: (A) latitudinal distribution (third-order polynomial regression) and (B) related to agriculture (area fraction within 10 km, in %). On each figure, the gray line represents the regression and the dotted lines represent the 95% confidence interval.

The concentrations of pesticides quantified on aerosol particles were minimal at ZPO (Svalbard) with 24.5 fg m–3 on average and ranged from 0.14 to 3.9 ng m–3 at agricultural sites (CRA and OPE sites, respectively) (Figure 2). On an individual substance point of view, cyprodinil, fenpropidin, prosulfocarb, and spiroxamine were the pesticides with the highest concentrations (i.e., up to 7.51, 3.53, 1.71, and 1.82 ng m–3, respectively), while for all other pesticides, their concentrations were mostly below 1 ng m–3.
Figure 2

Figure 2. Pesticide mean concentrations quantified at each site in the particulate (all sites) and gaseous phases (6 sites).

8 out of 11 pesticides exhibiting a quantification frequency exceeding 50% (Table S9) (i.e., cyprodinil, fenpropidin, fenpropimorph, metazachlor, S-metolachlor, spiroxamine, tebuconazole, and terbuthylazine) had their particulate concentrations spanning 3 to 6 orders of magnitude (log(cmax/cmin) = 3–6), while the other three (i.e., 2,4-D, atrazine, and thiacloprid) exhibited a more uniform distribution across the continent (log(cmax/cmin) ? 2 and RSD < 200%) (Table 1 and Figures S9 and S10). Moreover, for atrazine and thiacloprid, the concentration gradient from the source areas was particularly small: The average concentrations at remote sites (free tropospheric mountain and Arctic) were within an order of magnitude of the average concentrations at other sites (rural + coastal + mountain) (log(cos/crs) < 1; Table 1). The same was found for cyprodinil, spiroxamine, tebuconazole, and terbuthylazine. Such uniform distributions suggest that the atmospheric lifetime of the compounds is similarly long or its source distribution is similarly wide as that of atrazine. Atrazine, an herbicide banned since 2004, (50) continues to be present in European air, likely a consequence of its persistence and long-range transport from regions where it is still used. (3,51?53) Because of its persistence, atrazine keeps cycling in air, even 25 years after its ban in Europe. It is re-emitted from secondary sources, but primary sources outside Europe may also contribute. (54)
Among these frequently observed pesticides, 8 are approved for agricultural use in Europe, except for atrazine, fenpropimorph, and thiacloprid (Tables S5). Fenpropimorph is a fungicide banned shortly before our sampling campaign but remained authorized for use as a biocide until 2021. (55) Thiacloprid, banned for agricultural use in May 2020, is another exception. Among the less frequently found pesticides, acetochlor, carbaryl, and simazine, their European approvals had lapsed more than 9 years before our sampling. Interestingly, concentrations of these substances at remote sites did not significantly differ from those at rural sites by more than an order of magnitude (Table 1), indicating their persistence and long-range transport from regions where they are still in use, such as North America and Africa.
By hierarchical cluster analysis, we find a high degree of similarity in particulate pesticide substance patterns between sites far from application, i.e., polar and mountain sites, particularly evident during the third sampling period (Figures S11–S13).
Long-Range Atmospheric Transport (LRAT) of Pesticides
The substances prone to long-range atmospheric transport were identified using the samples collected at the polar sites as well as those collected at high mountain sites from free tropospheric air (see the Supporting Information for the determination of free tropospheric conditions at each site). Indeed, in the free troposphere, zonal and meridional transport is more efficient due to higher wind speeds and longer depositional lifetime. (56)
In the polar atmosphere, 19 pesticides were quantified, including 15 for which this is the first evidence of their potential to reach the Arctic. Out of these 19 pesticides, 12 were approved for agricultural use in Europe in 2020. In particular, most of these pesticides were quantified in the gas phase at the ZPO site, Svalbard (78.9°N). 13 pesticides were found in the four samples at mountain sites that were confirmed to have been collected exclusively in free tropospheric air (Table S8). This included 10 approved for agricultural use and 10 that were also found at the polar sites. Therefore, by combining the results from the polar and free tropospheric air samples, 22 pesticides were identified to be prone to LRAT (blue area in Figure 3), which included 15 approved for agricultural use in Europe.
Figure 3

Figure 3. Pesticides identified as prone to long-range atmospheric transport (blue area, FT = free tropospheric), pesticides quantified in the planetary boundary layer (white area), and pesticides never observed (gray area) ordered along model estimate of half-life in air. (36) Not pictured is one pesticide never observed, i.e., fluazinam, with a model-estimated half-life of 1956 h. Annual mean OH concentration of 7.5 × 105 cm?3 used for calculation of half-life in air.

Source regions, based on 30-day footprint analyses by the FLEXPART model, for the air collected from 28 to 30/04/2020 and 26–28/05/2020 at ZPO, Svalbard, are located in the North Atlantic and the inner Arctic (Figure S2) and contained the lowest number and concentrations of pesticides. Higher levels were quantified in the air collected from 12 to 14/05/2020 at ZPO, which originated from North America and the northernmost agricultural regions of Russia (Figure S2). Similar behavior has also been found for the two other polar sites, where higher numbers of pesticides were encountered in the samples, where air masses were influenced by Scandinavia and the British Isles (Figures S3 and S4). The origins of free tropospheric air collected at mountain sites were all from continental Europe (Figure S5).
Previous observations of more than 20 currently used pesticides in the polar regions in recent years have highlighted the LRAT potential of currently used pesticides (10,22?24) (Table S10). However, these studies have mainly focused on a limited number of currently used pesticides. In this study, 19 pesticides were found to be associated with LRAT at the polar sites. Out of these, four substances, atrazine, chlorpyrifos, pendimethalin, and triallate, had previously been reported in polar regions, whereas we are establishing the first evidence of LRAT for 15 pesticides that have previously not been encountered in these regions (Figure 3). Three of these substances, atrazine, chlorpyrifos, and diuron, are water policy-prioritized in the EU. The potential risk for the environment and human health is also evidenced by the fact that among the pesticides identified as prone to LRAT, 2 are carcinogens, 6 are genotoxic, 10 are endocrine disruptors, and 9 are reprotoxic. (10,57) In addition, the 22 long-range transported pesticides belong to 16 different chemical classes (57) and their physicochemical properties range widely, i.e., saturation vapor pressure ranging from 9.2 × 10–9 to 0.67 Pa with log KOW from 1.55 to 6.52 (Table S11), with chlorpyrifos, fenpropidin, fenpropimorph, pendimethalin, S-metolachlor, and spiroxamine potentially (logKow > 5) known to be bioaccumulative. (19)
There was a considerable shift of the pesticides’ gas/particle partitioning from the continent to the Arctic, with a higher gaseous fraction for 14 out of 15 pesticides observed at the polar sites than at midlatitude sites. This trend was most prominent for terbuthylazine, which was on average 99% in the particulate phase at rural sites but >98% in the gaseous phase at polar sites. The exception was triallate, which at one polar site was quantified in the particulate phase only (>87%, Table S12). Our observations suggest that pesticides which are predominantly partitioning to the particulate phase in aerosols over Europe tend to be found in the gaseous phase in the Arctic (Figure 2). This pattern is consistent with previous studies, with pesticides such as 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile, chloroneb, dicofol, nitrapyrin, and triallate observed only in the gas phase of Arctic air (22,24) (Table S10), while in in this study, pesticides in continental Europe preferentially partitioned to the particulate phase, as suggested by the results from mountains and rural sites where the gas phase was also collected. (15)
A preference for partitioning to the gas phase at polar sites can be explained by low aerosol mass and surface concentrations and the prevalence of hydrophilic particulate matter (PM) components in particular seasalt. (58) For example, at the central European rural site KOS (Czech Republic), the concentration of PM10 was 12.8 ?g m–3 on average during the study, while 4.3 ?g m–3 was measured at the polar site ZPO, Svalbard. (59) Organic matter is a key constituent influencing the partitioning of chemicals onto PM. (60) In continental Europe, the fraction of organic matter in PM is generally higher than that in the Arctic. At the rural sites adjacent to agriculture, the particulate organic carbon averaged 1.53 ?g m–3 (?12%), whereas at polar sites, it was more than 10-fold lower, 0.11 ?g m–3 (?3%) on average. No in-depth analysis of gas/particle partitioning is possible because of the lack of particulate phase chemical composition data for most of the sites. Another possible explanation could be volatilization of CUPs from melting snow, mixed into sample air shortly before collection, i.e., before complete relaxation to phase equilibrium. Volatilization from melting snow is expected for organic substances, which within snowpacks would partition significantly to the pore space, (61) however, this does not apply for the CUPs, which partitioning apparently shifted to the gas phase (Table S12).
The three polar sites included in this study had similar environmental conditions (temperature, PM concentration) but are distanced from each other by >1000 km and were influenced by different air masses (Figures S1–S5). Still, out of the 19 pesticides encountered at these sites, five were observed at more than one polar site, which provides independent evidence of long-range atmospheric transport. Moreover, we quantified 13 pesticides in free tropospheric air collected at three high mountain sites, indicating that they are prone to LRAT. 11 pesticides identified at those mountain sites were also identified at polar sites, thus providing strong evidence of their LRAT potential.
Current Limitations Regarding Pesticide Environmental Risk Assessments
Pesticide authorization in Europe presupposes environmental risk assessment with criteria for persistence, bioaccumulation potential, long-range transport potential, and toxicity for soil and water. However, there is no threshold value to consider a pesticide as persistent in the atmosphere. (27) The only parameter through which the atmosphere is included in the risk assessment procedure is the potential for long-range atmospheric transport. To assess this potential, the atmospheric half-life is used as a proxy. For this, only the reactivity with the OH radical in the gas phase is considered, using global and annual mean OH radical concentrations. (62) A pesticide exhibiting a half-life higher than 2 days is considered as prone to LRAT.
However, all 22 pesticides identified as prone to LRAT in this study have been estimated to have atmospheric half-lives shorter than 2 days based on the model currently used in the risk assessment (36) (Table S11). But OH concentrations can be much lower seasonally, at high latitudes, as well as during nighttime or in the polar night. (63) In these cases, degradation processes are substantially reduced, with correspondingly longer effective atmospheric half-lives and travel distances. (24) For instance, the atmospheric and total environmental lifetimes of atrazine are almost 1 order of magnitude longer for midlatitude winter than in summer (64) and the characteristic travel distance (CTD) of chlorpyrifos increases from 30 to 290 km with a 10-fold reduced OH concentration. (52) CTD is an indicator of a chemical’s long-range transport potential in a generic multicompartment environment under steady-state conditions and is influenced by also lifetime in soil and water. (52,65) It is defined as the distance from the source region at which the concentration is reduced by 63%. (66) Note that because of the generic nature of the underlying multimedia model, CTD is not suitable to test substance fate or should not be interpreted in absolute terms (km). CTDs of the targeted pesticides are estimated mostly below 100 km (median is 92 km) and are estimated even somewhat lower with a median of 68 km for the substances identified as prone to LRAT, suggesting that these chemicals are unlikely to reach remote locations. The CTD values or their ranking do not correspond with substances suggested from this or earlier studies to have high long-range transport potential, with only one exception, i.e., thiacloprid (Figure S14 and Table S11).
Moreover, for pesticides transported in the particulate phase, degradation is expected to be slower than in the gas phase due to diffusion limitation in low-viscosity aerosol particles. (33,67) Experiments on degradation rate coefficients with OH in the particulate phase suggest atmospheric half-lives of weeks (given global mean OH radical concentration). (33,34) Oxidation is particularly slow in aerosols transported at high altitudes or to high latitudes and expectedly most relevant for moderately polar pesticides such as carbamates, triazines, thiophosphoric acid esters, phenols, and anilines. (34,67) As confirmed in this study, pesticides tend to have higher particle-bound mass fractions in continental air than in polar air, and their persistence in air is therefore likely underestimated. This aspect is neglected by the current risk assessment practice.
Furthermore, the effective atmospheric lifetime of semivolatiles resisting degradation in soils and surface water can be much longer than the residence time in air based on degradation kinetics because of several cycles of revolatilization and deposition enhancing the LRAT potential (multihopping). (28)
In addition to the lack of information about active ingredients, the influence of application methods, formulants, and adjuvants on CUP emissions is not well known. While aerial application is banned in Europe, spraying of soil and plant, (12) volatilization, (68,69) and also pellet application to soil and seed treatment contribute to pesticide emissions. (70) Formulants and adjuvants are used to improve the effectiveness of application but can modify their effective vapor pressure and atmospheric half-lives. (71) A recent experimental study suggested that the reactivity of the chlorpyrifos with OH radicals was different in a commercial formulation than that of the substance alone. (35)
This study shows the limits of the risk assessment in place in the regulatory process on the atmospheric fate of pesticides and, in particular, their potential for LRAT, by providing empirical evidence in direct contrast to current model predictions. There is a real need to revise the current methods used for environmentally relevant conditions (different temperature and/or OH concentrations) as well as to obtain more experimental data on atmospheric degradability of pesticides including pesticide formulations and preparations, in addition to data from monitoring studies. Currently, the framework does not consider partitioning into the particulate phase or slowed degradation in soil/water during the multihopping. More realistic modeling is extremely important if we want to ensure that the pesticides authorized for agricultural use in Europe (and elsewhere) do not contaminate the environment and pose health risks hundreds of thousands of kilometers away from the source areas.

"Bees are essential pollinators of many crops and wild plants, and pesticide exposure is one of the key environmental stressors affecting their health in anthropogenically modified landscapes. Until recently, almost all information on routes and impacts of pesticide exposure came from honey bees, at least partially because they were the only model species required for environmental risk assessments (ERAs) for insect pollinators. Recently, there has been a surge in research activity focusing on pesticide exposure and effects for non-Apis bees, including other social bees (bumble bees and stingless bees) and solitary bees. These taxa vary substantially from honey bees and one another in several important ecological traits, including spatial and temporal activity patterns, foraging and nesting requirements, and degree of sociality. In this article, we review the current evidence base about pesticide exposure pathways and the consequences of exposure for non-Apis bees. We find that the insights into non-Apis bee pesticide exposure and resulting impacts across biological organizations, landscapes, mixtures, and multiple stressors are still in their infancy. The good news is that there are many promising approaches that could be used to advance our understanding, with priority given to informing exposure pathways, extrapolating effects, and determining how well our current insights (limited to very few species and mostly neonicotinoid insecticides under unrealistic conditions) can be generalized to the diversity of species and lifestyles in the global bee community. We conclude that future research to expand our knowledge would also be beneficial for ERAs and wider policy decisions concerning pollinator conservation and pesticide regulation.

"Under the looming shadow of a sixth mass extinction of species (41), with mounting evidence of declines in terrestrial arthropods (73, 152, 190, 194, 195), there is an urgent need to understand the unintended impacts of pesticide use for non-target arthropods. Despite substantial research and policy focus on this issue for bees over the past two decades, much of our understanding of the routes and impacts of pesticide exposure has come from honey bees (Apis mellifera) (186). This is primarily driven by their use as an insect pollinator model species for regulatory pesticide risk assessments, motivated by their convenience for ecotoxicological testing (30, 60, 69) and interests in bee products and crop pollination. However, honey bee ecology and life history are atypical for bees. In contrast, the majority of the approximately 20,000 bee species worldwide do not live in perennial, social colonies in cavities, but are instead solitary, and many species spend most of their life developing and living in soil (44).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The honey bee may be no more or less sensitive to the direct effects of pesticides than other bees or even insects more generally (9, 74). However, when considering bees in their ecological or (non)social context, there is an emerging understanding that honey bees may not represent pesticide use consequences for the vast majority of solitary bee species (44); the approximately 250 bumble bee species that are social for only part of their life cycle (61); or the approximately 600 stingless bee species that, like honey bees, live in perennial, social colonies (71). Recent years have seen increased focus on routes and impacts of pesticide exposure for these non-Apis bee species, even if most studies are focused on a limited set of species that can be kept in captivity and on the impacts of neonicotinoid insecticides (42, 159).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this review, we shine a light on the current understanding of pesticide exposure and its effects for non-Apis bees, singly and in combination with other environmental stressors, from individual to population and ecosystem consequences, and from the laboratory to the field. We approach bee diversity and consequences of pesticide use through a lens of ecological traits, since such traits are anticipated to modify the bees’ pesticide exposure and subsequent impacts. These traits include the seasonal phenology of their activity (flight) period during the year, diurnal activity patterns, floral preferences (lecty), nesting ecology (including construction materials and location), degree of sociality, individual or colony longevity, foraging range, and mobility in the landscape (32, 87, 153, 180, 188, 202). Furthermore, we consider pesticide effects combined with other environmental stressors, including land-use intensification (and related habitat loss and fragmentation); climate change; and the spread of alien species, pathogens, and diseases (103, 135, 192). We end by highlighting important areas of future research and reflecting on the environmental risk assessment (ERA) of pesticides and the wider policy context relevant to bee conservation and pesticide regulation.

"2.? PESTICIDE EXPOSURE									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pesticide exposure pathways emerge from the spatiotemporal intersection between bee activity patterns and pesticide contamination of the landscape—the latter resulting from pesticide use and fate [conceptualized by Sponsler et al. (162)]. It is therefore essential to understand both spatial and temporal patterns of pesticide use, accounting for distribution and degradation, as well as where bees occupy the landscape, i.e., their habitat use, over their life cycle and how they use and come into contact with different materials to understand bee pesticide exposure. On a global scale, high bee species richness (128) and greater pesticide use on cropland (177) co-occur in South and North America and the Mediterranean regions ( Figure 1 ). Such spatial co-occurrence could indicate the potential for substantial pesticide exposure for a significant part of these bee communities. Bees can be exposed to pesticides throughout their life cycle—during foraging, nest construction, brood care, and hibernation and through either oral (nectar, pollen, water, or honeydew) or contact (air, plants, propolis or resin, wax, or soil) exposure—with exposure being species and life stage dependent (30). We illustrate these different pesticide exposure pathways among bees and influences of nesting and foraging habits in Figure 2 .									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"2.1.?  Relative Importance of Exposure Pathways Varies Across Bee Taxa									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Oral exposure to pesticide residues via the consumption and transportation of nectar and pollen, by adults foraging either for their own needs or to provision their offspring, is common to all bee taxa. Larval exposure likely depends on whether females provide mass provisions (solitary and stingless bees) or sequentially feed their brood (honey and bumble bees) (44, 61, 71). Mass provisions for a single brood cell might be collected within a few hours or a day, representing a discrete snapshot of potential environmental pesticide exposure. Thus, the extent and magnitude of pesticide exposure could vary among brood cells within a nest or colony if they were provisioned at different times. In contrast, the larvae of sequentially provisioned species will be exposed to potentially fluctuating pesticide residues in nectar and pollen over the collection and colony storage periods. Honey bee larvae are fed brood food (secretions from nurse bees’ hypopharyngeal and mandibular glands) that may differ in terms of pesticide residues from the nectar and pollen collected due to detoxification and processing by nurse bees (21).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pesticide residues in water represent a possible route of exposure for adult bees from most taxa, although the likelihood of exposure is much greater for honey or stingless bee workers that regularly collect water for nest thermoregulation (30, 39). Bumble bees and the majority of solitary bees rarely, if ever, specifically collect water, instead obtaining what they need from nectar (69, 153). Collection of sugary exudates from homopteran (honeydew) or plant (guttation fluid) sources represents a potential exposure route for honey, bumble, and stingless bee workers, with honeydew representing the more important exposure pathway for Apis and stingless bees, for whom guttation fluid is less important (30, 39, 71).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Contact exposure to pesticide residues in the air likely represents a common route of exposure for all adult bees (regardless of species) as they fly around the environment (30), although the extent and relative risks of exposure will depend on spatiotemporal patterns of both pesticide use and activity by different taxa. Similar to air, contact exposure to pesticide residues on plants is likely to be a consistent route of exposure across bee taxa, particularly for bees foraging on treated crops in agricultural landscapes and for male solitary or bumble bees, which rest among plants instead of returning to a nest overnight. Adult female bees, particularly solitary leafcutting bees, are also likely to experience oral (but not dietary) exposure through plant material (e.g., leaf or petal pieces) that they collect to line and/or separate brood cells (97). Contact exposure for developing larvae and (pre)pupae is also likely to represent a more significant route of exposure for leafcutting bees than for the brood of other bee taxa. Many bee taxa collect oils and resins from plants to incorporate into their nest structure (e.g., stingless, honey, and many solitary bee species) and/or for the creation of scents (e.g., male euglossine bees). Contact with pesticide residues via resin is likely a more important route of exposure for stingless bees, which use these plant exudates extensively, followed by honey bees (which turn resins into propolis) and bumble bees and some solitary bees (30). Honey, bumble, and stingless bees secrete and manipulate wax for nest construction, with adults and larvae coming into contact with these structures for weeks, months, or years. Lipophilic pesticide residues are more likely to accumulate in such wax structures (120), creating the potential for both acute and chronic contact exposure for these bee taxa.									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2.2.?  Nesting Habits Influence Bees’ Pesticide Exposure									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Solitary ground-nesting species account for approximately 75% of the estimated 20,000 bee species worldwide (6); thus, extended periods of contact with soil likely represent an important route of exposure to pesticide residues (58, 153, 199). While excavating nests in the ground, adult females can dig through and move many hundreds of times their own body mass in soil (199). Offspring could come into contact with pesticides in soil used to create their brood cell throughout their development from egg, to larva, to pupa, with exposure duration potentially being long-lasting (2, 3, 201). Pesticide exposure through soil has also been suggested for some solitary and stingless bee species that use mud for nest construction (39, 153) and bumble bee queens that hibernate underground (139). Both solitary and stingless bees use a diversity of nesting places and materials, which, in addition to soil and mud, make resins, petals, leaves, stems, and wood potentially relevant for their exposure pathways (39, 153).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The extent to which pesticides in soil can penetrate the larval or adult cuticle is currently unknown. Secretions and modifications to the linings of brood cells (e.g., those produced by cellophane bees) could also affect such rates of transfer and cuticular penetration by pesticides. At this time, the extent to which such brood cell linings vary among bee taxa and how this trait variation might affect pesticide exposure scenarios are unknown. However, simply focusing on exposure through materials is not enough, since the frequency of encountering the materials and the duration and extent of contact or consumption of them, as well as uptake and toxicity, also matter. Willis Chan et al. (199) provide an example of how these many aspects could be combined for ground-nesting solitary bees to estimate pesticide risk and conclude that, for this group of bees, soil is an important route of exposure, driven mainly by the amount of soil that the female handles and ingests during nest construction.									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2.3.?  Foraging Habits Influence Bees’ Pesticide Exposure									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Most bees are central place foragers (for more or less all of their adult lives), collecting nectar and pollen from flowers in their surroundings and bringing these resources back to their central nest. Bees’ foraging ranges are thus an integral part of their ecology (88), and the spatial arrangement among nests and flowers determines how bees are distributed across the landscape and therefore their pesticide exposure. Bees can be exposed when they are foraging on treated crops in bloom (70, 142) but also through non-crop plants within or beyond treated fields when pesticides drift and leach into the surroundings (27, 110, 168). Taxon-specific foraging ranges and preferences for different crops and non-crop habitats (138, 145), in combination with crop- and landscape-specific pesticide use patterns, result in variation in exposure among bees (30, 39, 126, 162, 188) ( Figure 2 ).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Exposure patterns likely depend on key traits shared within groups of species or functional guilds. For example, it has been suggested that species that forage over larger areas are more extensively exposed to pesticides compared to species with more limited foraging ranges because the former exploit large but widely scattered resource patches (96), which in agricultural landscapes are often made up of pesticide-treated flowering crops. Honey bees collect a substantial amount of their pollen from oilseed rape and fruit crops (117, 193), in contrast to Osmia spp. solitary bees, which favor non-crop, predominantly woody, pollen sources (131, 145) ( Figure 2 ). Thus, exposure patterns are also likely to be tempered by diet breadth, with specialist species being more predictably linked to the residue profiles of their particular forage plants, for example, Eucera pruinosa to cucurbits (200) and Osmia brevicornis to brassicas (78). A similar relationship seems likely for the temporal scale of activity, with taxa with longer active flight periods (e.g., stingless bee colonies) likely being exposed to more variable pesticide exposure scenarios (87).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2.4.?  Pesticide Mixtures and Life Cycle Exposure Across Landscapes									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bees encounter pesticides in the environment as mixtures, a fact that is well established for honey bees and increasingly obvious for non-Apis bees (e.g., 20, 28, 45, 70, 96, 114, 115, 126, 145, 196). Such mixture exposure can come from intentional tank mixtures of pesticides but most often can be attributed to the differential habitats and materials used by bees, resulting from their nesting and foraging habits (30, 181). Pesticide-treated cropland, particularly including orchard and vegetable crops, can increase both the amount and diversity of pesticides that bees are exposed to through nectar, pollen, and soil compared to diversified farmland containing more semi-natural areas (70, 96, 126, 139, 199). Pesticide exposure patterns are therefore expected to be landscape context dependent, and this dependence may vary among bee taxa (96). For example, Botías et al. (28) found that specimens of five bumble bee species contained higher frequencies and concentrations of pesticides in agricultural compared to urban environments. However, the underlying drivers of exposure in different bee species and contexts is not well understood, even though this understanding is essential for both predicting pesticide effects and developing strategies for risk mitigation (162, 188).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A more holistic view of bee life cycle and activity patterns, combined with information on different pesticide residues in multiple bee species and relevant materials collected simultaneously in several places and time points, would enhance our understanding of pathways for mixture exposure. Such studies are beginning to accumulate (e.g., 86, 174, 196, 199) but are not yet sufficient for general conclusions. Ward et al. (196) found that pesticide concentrations were highest in flowers and lowest in soil and similar between wild and honey bees, while Willis Chan et al. (199) concluded that insecticide concentrations were similar in soil and pollen but that there were higher maximum concentrations in soil. In European agricultural soils (2005–2009), the most frequently detected insecticide was DDT, at concentrations up to 5,830 ng/g soil, and 7% of the samples contained imidacloprid, the only screened neonicotinoid, at concentrations up to 60 ng/g (155).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3.? PESTICIDE EFFECTS									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pesticide exposure provides only part of the puzzle, and it is not until we consider the consequences of exposure that we can draw any conclusions about the possible harm that pesticide use may cause for bees. Until relatively recently, an apparent mismatch existed between laboratory studies (under more controlled conditions) on (sub)individual levels showing impacts of pesticide exposure and results from field studies (measuring responses from agricultural use patterns in landscapes) showing limited impacts (60, 156). This was particularly true for studies of sublethal exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides, for which abundant evidence of impacts existed from laboratory studies and few, if any, measurable impacts of exposure had been found under semi-field or field conditions (66–68, 113). Studies focusing on non-Apis bee species over the past 10–15 years have been critical to bridge and resolve these apparent mismatches (104, 186).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3.1.?  Lethal Effects on Individuals and Relative Sensitivity Across Bee Taxa									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mortality and lifespan effects of acute and chronic exposure during different life stages, including those found by dose-response studies, can vary substantially among both bee taxa and pesticides. Expanding lethal endpoint studies (e.g., LD/LC50 estimation) to non-Apis taxa has provided important insights on taxonomic variation in sensitivity (9). For example, A. mellifera can be 1,000 times more sensitive to acute oral exposure (24 h) to acephate (organophosphate) than B. terrestris (47), and Nannotrigona perilampoides can be 2,085 times more sensitive to acute contact exposure (24 h) to thiacloprid (neonicotinoid) than A. mellifera (83, 189). Even restricting comparisons to those between honey and bumble bees, perhaps the next most-studied bee taxon after A. mellifera, differences in sensitivity appear to be inconsistent. For example, imidacloprid is 2,058 times more toxic to bumble bees than carbaryl (carbamate) in contact toxicity assays, imidacloprid is three times more toxic to bumble than to honey bees, and carbaryl is 49 times more toxic to honey than to bumble bees (147). Such differences in relative sensitivity have also been seen in comparisons of acute oral toxicity for different insecticides—sulfoxaflor (sulfoximine) and thiamethoxam (neonicotinoid) are 8.3 times and 3.3 times, respectively, more acutely toxic to Bombus impatiens than to A. mellifera, whereas flupyradifurone (butenolide) is more acutely toxic to A. mellifera than to B. impatiens (121).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The intrinsic sensitivity of B. terrestris and Osmia bicornis to neonicotinoids appears to be determined by the activity of certain cytochrome P450 enzymes of the CYP9Q subfamily (18, 116), with species lacking these enzymes showing greater sensitivity (76). For example, Megachile rotundata lacks such P450 enzymes and is 170 to over 2,500 times more sensitive to acute contact exposure compared to other tested bee species (76). Such interspecific differences in detoxification ability for certain pesticides could also explain the substantially greater sensitivity of M. rotundata to contact pyrethroid exposure compared to B. impatiens and Osmia lignaria (53–68 times; 151). There is, however, very little known about how this detoxification capacity generalizes beyond this handful of species.									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As with honey bees, there is also substantial variation in the relative toxicity of different pesticides for non-Apis bees. For example, thiamethoxam is at least 1,133 times more toxic to B. impatiens than another systemic insecticide, flupyradifurone (121), and the biopesticide spinosad is 1.95 times more toxic than imidacloprid to Melipona quadrifasciata (182). The lethal toxicity of different neonicotinoids varied substantially for Tetragonisca angustula, with N-nitroguanidine compounds (imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) being up to 193 times more toxic than the N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoids (acetamiprid and thiacloprid) (84). A recent comparison of acute oral thiamethoxam toxicity suggested that all three stingless bee species (Melipona scutellaris, Scaptotrigona postica, and T. angustula) tested were 6.6–127.6 times more sensitive than A. mellifera (111). However, A. mellifera was 2.4 times more sensitive to oral imidacloprid exposure than Partamona helleri (184), while this stingless species was 797 times more susceptible than honey bees to deltamethrin (pyrethroid).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Body size can be an important factor influencing both intra- and interspecific sensitivity of bees to pesticides (108, 149). For example, both B. terrestris and O. bicornis showed intraspecific variation in sensitivity to sulfoxaflor and Amistar (azoxystrobin fungicide; 108). Although bee weight was a useful predictor of pesticide sensitivity, this alone could not explain observed variability between sexes and castes. Although three stingless bee species tested were consistently more sensitive to thiamethoxam than honey bees, the relative order of stingless bee species sensitivity was different if body mass was taken into account (111).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Given the substantial interspecific variability in lethal toxicity for bees exposed to individual pesticides shown to date, more research is warranted to further determine which model species (in addition to A. mellifera), safety factors, and other measures should be considered in ERAs for pesticides. In the real world, bees (and other insect pollinators) are most likely exposed to combinations of multiple pesticides, making understanding mixture toxicity essential (23, 65, 77, 80, 137, 147). Clearly, it is important to determine whether exposure to such mixtures produces antagonistic, additive, or synergistic impacts on toxicity and how this might vary among bee taxa. For example, the lethal toxicity of clothianidin (neonicotinoid) for B. terrestris and O. bicornis can be substantially and synergistically increased (approximately three times) when combined with propiconazole (SBI fungicide) (137).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is also worth considering potential differences in toxicity between specific pesticide active ingredients (AIs) and the proprietary formulations used in agriculture, which can contain multiple AIs along with other co-formulants (surfactants, wetting agents, etc.). In some cases, the toxicity of proprietary formulations can be caused by co-formulants—for example, co-formulants in Roundup products (rather than the glyphosate herbicide AI) appear to represent a substantial lethal risk to bumble bees by matting body hair and possibly overwhelming the gas exchange system (170).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3.2.?  Information About Sublethal Effects on Individuals, and Our Mechanistic Understanding of Their Consequences, Hinges on Studies of Non-Apis Species									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Real-world pesticide exposure should occur at levels substantially below lethal thresholds for bee taxa. However, pesticides (particularly insecticides) designed to impair the normal function of pests can also have sublethal impacts on the physiology and behavior of non-target organisms, including bees. Studies of non-Apis bees, particularly bumble bees exposed to neonicotinoid insecticides, have been critical in developing our understanding of sublethal impacts of exposure on individual bees (and how they affect bumble bee colony function) and a mechanistic understanding of their wider consequences for populations (Section 3.3) and pollination (Section 3.4).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Consumption of pesticide-contaminated nectar by bumble bees can lead to reductions in the amount and rate of feeding (antifeedant effects) (29, 100–102; C.G. Strang, S. Rondeau, N. Baert, S. McArt, N.E. Raine and F. Muth, unpublished manuscript), preferences for consuming neonicotinoid-treated sugar solution (8, 91; but see 123), and impairment of associative learning (132, 161, 167) and spatial working memory (146). However, while exposure to thiamethoxam or imidacloprid can lead to impaired bumble bee learning and memory (but see 122), workers exposed to another neonicotinoid (clothianidin) (133) or sulfoxaflor (160) showed no measurable effects—despite all of these insecticides having the same mode of action (targeting nicotinic acetylcholine receptors).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bumble bee flight (89, 90) and foraging performance (7, 55, 64, 65, 163, 166) can be impaired by neonicotinoid consumption. Neonicotinoid-exposed bumble bee workers can have reduced motivation to forage (98, 122), altered floral preferences (64, 164), and impaired flower handling skills (164, 175, 198); collect pollen less frequently and in smaller loads (55, 64, 65, 166); and perform longer foraging trips (166). Shortfalls in individual pollen foraging performance can be buffered to some extent at the colony level by more workers going out to forage when bumble bees are exposed to either imidacloprid (64, 65) or thiamethoxam (166). Pollen collection by solitary bees can also be affected by pesticide exposure, with female E. pruinosa collecting 5.3 times less cucurbit pollen when exposed to imidacloprid (201), as well as collecting 32% less pollen per visit and spending 24% less time handling squash flowers when exposed to the fungicide Quadris Top—a mix of azoxystrobin and difenoconazole (S. Rondeau and N.E. Raine, unpublished manuscript). Imidacloprid exposure also appears to affect color preferences and decrease locomotion in the stingless bee P. helleri (1).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although there is some evidence that honey bee homing and navigation performance can be affected by neonicotinoid exposure (56), there is less convincing evidence for non-Apis bees. Solitary O. cornuta bees exposed to clothianidin were less able to learn how to navigate by walking to a feeding site under laboratory conditions (85), and more worker bumble bees from imidacloprid- or thiamethoxam-exposed colonies failed to return from presumed foraging trips (64, 65, 166). However, results from remote releases of bumble bees exposed to thiamethoxam revealed that a higher proportion of workers from pesticide-treated colonies returned from 1 km, with no measurable impact of pesticide exposure on homing performance over 2 km or when all data were analyzed together (166).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pesticide exposure can also affect the motivation and performance of non-Apis bees in excavating underground nests (201), recognizing nest locations (10), and locating potential hibernation sites (S. Rondeau and N.E. Raine, unpublished manuscript). Eucera pruinosa females exposed to imidacloprid established 85% fewer nests than untreated controls in a semi-field enclosure experiment (201). Contact exposure to the fungicides Rovral 4F (iprodione) and Pristine (pyraclostrobin and boscalid mixture) and their adjuvant (N-90, a non-ionic wetting agent consisting of 90% polyethoxylated nonylphenol) sprayed onto vegetation in cage studies disrupted nest cavity recognition for M. rotundata females (10). Cavity-nesting O. lignaria bees exposed to imidacloprid-treated soil also showed impaired nesting activity—although this occurred at higher levels of exposure (?390 ppb; 58). Interestingly, soil moisture had substantial impacts on female mortality, with no mortality at 20% compared to >50% mortality at 40% soil moisture irrespective of pesticide exposure level (58). Osmia lignaria females showed no evidence of avoiding imidacloprid-treated soils for nesting material even when faced with a choice between soils with 0 and 1,000 ppb (57). Bombus impatiens queens are substantially more likely to choose pesticide-treated soils when seeking hibernation sites (S. Rondeau and N.E. Raine, unpublished manuscript). Queens showed a preference for all five pesticides used in this choice experiment, including two fungicides (boscalid and difenoconazole) and two different classes of insecticide (neonicotinoids and diamides), over pesticide-free soil. Survival of B. terrestris queens was significantly reduced over a 4-month hibernation period following oral exposure to a mixture of clothianidin and thiamethoxam, and surviving queens exposed to these pesticides lost more weight during hibernation than untreated controls (53). In contrast, hibernation survival of B. impatiens queens exposed to soil treated with either diamide insecticides (chlorantraniliprole and cyantraniliprole) or fungicides (boscalid and difenoconazole), singly or in combination, was not adversely affected (S. Rondeau and N.E. Raine, unpublished manuscript).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Colony establishment by bumble bee queens can also be impaired by pesticide exposure. Exposure to thiamethoxam led to a reduction in terminal oocyte length in queens of four different Bombus species (17) and a 26% reduction in the proportion of B. terrestris queens that laid eggs and advanced the timing of colony initiation (15). Similar patterns were observed for B. impatiens queens exposed to a range of imidacloprid concentrations (0.3–25 ppb), with dose-dependent queen mortality, weight loss, dramatically reduced activity levels, and delays in egg laying and nest initiation (106, 207). Exposure to boscalid residues in soil doubled the likelihood of B. impatiens queens surviving through the colony initiation period (after successful hibernation) and laying eggs (S. Rondeau and N.E. Raine, unpublished manuscript).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bumble bee colony growth can be impaired by exposure to neonicotinoid (33, 40, 51, 54, 64, 65, 99, 197) or sulfoxaflor (157) insecticides and the landscape exposure created by agricultural pesticide use (126) but appeared to be unaffected by chlorantraniliprole sprayed onto flowering turf grass (99). Chronic dietary exposure to neonicotinoids can lead to consumption of less food, production of fewer workers with truncated production, reduced worker longevity, and larger worker size in B. terrestris (40, 54, 165). Queens in imidacloprid-treated colonies are more inactive and spend less time on brood care (40). Imidacloprid exposure also impairs brood care by B. impatiens workers, affects spatial and social dynamics in the colony, and impairs colony thermoregulation (43). Consumption of artificial nectar, activity levels, and thoracic temperature were all reduced in O. bicornis orally exposed to imidacloprid but not measurably affected by exposure to other neonicotinoids [acetamiprid (11) or clothianidin (125)] or a triazole fungicide [myclobutanil (11)]. Contact exposure to imidacloprid-treated soil led to species- and sex-specific impacts on speed of larval development and adult longevity in O. lignaria and M. rotundata (2). Melipona quadrifasciata anthidioides larvae are highly sensitive to imidacloprid consumption, with larval mortality above 50% at concentrations higher than 0.0056 ?g AI/bee (183). Although body mass and developmental time of surviving larvae appeared unaffected by imidacloprid exposure, mushroom body development and walking behavior were affected (183).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3.3.?  Effects on Reproduction and Populations Depend on Life History and Link to Mitigation and Bee Conservation									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bee species differ in their intrinsic sensitivity to pesticides (9, 72, 74, 76) and therefore their ability to resist or recover after exposure, which, at a population level, often depends on their life-history traits (149, 188). Disregarding immigration and emigration, populations are determined by the balance between fecundity and mortality, which results from resource availability and interspecific interactions (154). Our understanding of the role that pesticides play in limiting bee populations by affecting overwintering survival, mate finding, and ability to reproduce is severely limited to a few species—primarily managed species—and mainly to neonicotinoids and other insecticides (46), and evidence from real landscapes is rare (104, 156, 159).

"For solitary bees, there is a lack of data on pesticide effects for even the most basic aspects of reproduction, such as offspring production, offspring development from egg to adult, and overwintering success (104). Population-level effects are challenging both to track over time and to attribute specifically to pesticide use, among the many different factors that impact bee populations. Our best evidence of direct population-related effects of agricultural pesticide exposure on solitary bees comes from short-term studies focusing on specific neonicotinoid uses in focal fields (142, 203, 205) and the terrestrial mesocosms of solitary bee populations enclosed in cages with pesticide-treated flowers (e.g., 150, 172, 173, 201), often referred to as semi-field conditions. In two such multi-year cage studies evaluating soil treatment with the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, offspring production was reduced by 71% in the cavity-nesting O. lignaria (173) ( Figure 3 ) and by 89% in the ground-nesting E. pruinosa (201). These results line up with laboratory imidacloprid exposure studies showing reduced male fertility in O. cornuta (171) and resulting in male-biased and halved offspring production in O. bicornis (148). However, seed treatment with the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam in the product FarMore or spray application with other insecticides before crop bloom (Closer containing sulfoxaflor, Coragen containing chlorantraniliprole) or a fungicide (Amistar containing azoxystrobin) led to no measurable offspring reduction in E. pruinosa (201) or O. bicornis (150). These examples serve to illustrate that, even if pesticides can have population-relevant impacts on bees, outcomes are likely to vary with application method and timing in relation to crop bloom, as well as exposure pathways including different exposure routes (soil during nesting or pollen and nectar during foraging) and environmental fates (degradation) of the pesticide products.									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Figure 3?Population effects result from intergenerational sublethal (in this case, reproduction and sex ratio) effects driven by a combination of pesticide exposure and forage resource limitation in many current agricultural landscapes. (a) An Osmia lignaria female produces, on average, 37 offspring under optimal conditions (high flower resource availability, no pesticide exposure, and protected from other stressors in a cage; green oval), with 41% of offspring being female (red bees) and 59% male (blue bees) (172). Under pesticide exposure and food stress conditions but still protected in the cage (orange oval), she produces only 16 offspring, of which 13% are female and 87% are male (172). (b–d) When this is extrapolated to following generations and to real agricultural landscapes, the population growth rate (?) is approximately (b) 2 in landscapes with abundant floral resources and low pesticide exposure, (c) 0.5 in landscapes with high pesticide exposure, and (d) 0.2 under low flower resource conditions (173).

"For B. terrestris and B. impatiens, exposure to neonicotinoids reduced hibernation success (53) and egg laying (17) and delayed colony initiation (15, 207), indicating the potential for population-level consequences. Additionally, reductions in the production of reproductive offspring (gynes and males)—an important metric for bumble bee population persistence—have been related to exposure to neonicotinoids and other insecticides through field-realistically contaminated food (119, 157, 197), to neonicotinoids through agricultural use (142, 203, 205), and to pesticide mixtures created by bees foraging within a landscape (126, 145)—the latter expanding to another species, Bombus vosnesenskii. There are also indications that pesticide mixtures, in this case, the combination of neonicotinoids and pyrethroids, could contribute to colony failure (65), with possible population-level consequences. However, there are also examples from similar field or field-realistic studies of other pesticides, such as other neonicotinoids, being compatible with maintained offspring production (95, 143)—again highlighting the importance of exposure level and pesticide product.									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Reproduction effects observed after neonicotinoid exposure under laboratory or semi-field conditions might not necessarily be observed under field conditions (156); this lack of transferability of outcomes from controlled to natural conditions partly relates to colony and population recovery processes. Once affected by pesticides, populations of mobile organisms could recover through demographic or recolonization recovery (see 141). Demographic recovery can occur through increased fitness due to more resources or reduced resource competition or through individuals or life stages that escape or are resistant to exposure, which in bees could include egg or pupal life stages and be influenced by context, such as flower resource availability (172) and traits such as generation time, life span, and voltinism (see 141). Sociality might be a trait that influences demographic recovery, allowing loss of part of the workforce without losing their reproductive potential, a buffer lacking in solitary species (33, 42, 60, 169). Such social buffering could be one factor explaining why O. bicornis nesting and B. terrestris colony growth and gyne production were negatively affected by Elado (a mixture of the neonicotinoid clothianidin and the pyrethroid ?-cyfluthrin) seed treatment in spring-sown oilseed rape, while A. mellifera colony growth was not measurably affected (142).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Recolonization recovery (see 141) can occur in complex landscapes made up of mosaics of land covers and land uses that are more or less suitable habitat (24) and where bees may be more or less exposed to pesticides (139). This type of recovery has been suggested to occur in bees through the buffering capacity of (semi)natural areas (129). If pesticide exposure causes population reduction on a local scale, then the population size may be restored by dispersal from nearby source habitats such as semi-natural, less disturbed areas (129). However, if local populations are repeatedly extinguished in one (sink) area, and recolonization occurs by immigration of individuals from source habitats, then the sink could reduce the overall population, eventually leading to landscape-scale extinction (see 185). The potential for recolonization recovery has been suggested to be influenced by traits such as dispersal ability and territorial behavior, with less mobile species, such as solitary compared to (eu)social bee species (88), and species with a fixed territory, such as bees during their nesting phase, having a higher risk of local extinction from pesticides (see 141). Despite the importance of recovery processes in maintaining long-term population persistence, there have been limited research efforts in this direction for non-Apis bees, likely due to the logistical and resource limitations of landscape-level field studies. Pollinator population models could provide an opportunity to combine data from (more limited) field studies and expert knowledge to better understand complex ecological processes over sufficient space and time (62, 75).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition to acting as dispersal sources, semi-natural areas could provide added flower resources in either overgrown and abandoned or intensified production landscapes. Evidence is building that access to abundant and diverse floral resources can reduce pesticide exposure and thereby mitigate fitness effects, or even reduce effects under maintained exposure, in cages (82, 93, 172, 204) and in agricultural landscapes (145). Combining findings on the reproduction effects of imidacloprid exposure and floral resources for O. lignaria in cages with those of flower resource levels in intensively managed agricultural landscapes indicated that population persistence is only likely under conditions of low pesticide exposure and high flower resource availability (173) ( Figure 3 ). Above, we discuss mostly the direct effects that pesticides might have on bee populations. However, pesticide, and more specifically herbicide, use may not necessarily affect bees directly; instead, it most likely affects bees indirectly by reducing the availability and extent of floral resources (26). Farmland management advice can include the removal of non-crop flowering plants before pesticide application to reduce exposure; however, this likely is counterproductive and contributes to, rather than prevents, bee decline (124). Even if both pesticide-treated crop and contaminated non-crop flowers expose bees to pesticides, the flowers can provide a net reproductive benefit (95, 143, 145).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3.4.?  Effects on Communities and Ecosystem Functions Are Poorly Understood and Used									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Understanding how pesticide exposure might affect the structure and dynamics of wild pollinator communities and the critical ecosystem (pollination) services that they provide to crops and wild plant communities is essential. Currently, there is limited knowledge of pesticide impacts on the diversity of non-Apis bees and their pollination services and of how to incorporate management of such species to facilitate ecosystem service delivery, given our current reliance on pesticides in crop production.									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Agricultural intensification, including increases in the use of insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides, has led to substantial negative impacts on wild plant and beneficial insect biodiversity and calls within the European Union for a Europe-wide shift toward farming with minimal use of pesticides over large areas (63). However, while reductions in pesticide exposure associated with organic practices can have beneficial impacts for non-Apis bees (e.g., 81, 144) and the pollination services that they provide (e.g., 4), these effects are not ubiquitous (e.g., 31).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Long-term UK occupancy data suggest that wild bee species documented to forage from oilseed rape were substantially less likely to persist in a specific location due to the negative impacts of neonicotinoid exposure (206). Persistent neonicotinoid contamination of soils in crop fields and margins has been associated with reduced native bee species richness (114, 115), supporting the emerging view that soils remain an understudied route of exposure and potential risk for non-Apis bees. Declines in wild bee abundance and species richness were also correlated with increasing pesticide use in New York state apple orchards one year after application (129). These negative effects of pesticide exposure on wild bees appear to be driven primarily by fungicide applications before apple bloom, despite the fact that fungicides are often considered relatively safe for bees (129, 140). These deleterious impacts of pesticide exposure for wild bee biodiversity were at least partially buffered by greater amounts of natural habitat in the landscape surrounding apple orchards (129).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bumble bee (B. terrestris) colonies exposed to thiamethoxam visited flowers less frequently and collected pollen less often from apple trees in a cage study (163). Importantly, the foraging activities of these pesticide-exposed bees contributed to the production of apples containing fewer seeds, indicating reduced delivery of pollination services. Changes in pollination service provision to this crop can likely be explained by pesticide-exposure impacts at the colony, rather than the individual behavioral, level. Bombus terrestris colonies exposed to either the pesticide product Closer (containing sulfoxaflor) or Amistar (containing azoxystrobin) sprayed directly onto Phacelia tanacetifolia plants showed impaired foraging performance in a cage study (176), and bees exposed to Amistar deposited fewer pollen grains on Phacelia flowers than untreated controls. Bombus impatiens colonies exposed to a mixture of imidacloprid (neonicotinoid soil drench) and lambda-cyhalothrin (pyrethroid foliar spray) delivered substantially reduced pollination services to watermelon (32% reduction in fruit set) in a cage study (82). Bumble bee colony survival was dramatically reduced in insecticide-treated cages without supplemental clover, suggesting that supplemental forage can ameliorate the negative impacts of insecticide exposure for crop-pollinating bees. Osmia bicornis foraging on clothianidin-treated oilseed rape showed impaired performance as pollinators of strawberries, with berries weighing approximately 10% less in neonicotinoid-treated cages (79). Exposure to a fungal biopesticide (Metarhizium anisopliae, developed by ICIPE) applied as a spray had no measurable effects on mortality, foraging behavior, or pollination service provision by the African stingless bee (Meliponula ferruginea) to a greenhouse cucumber crop (127).

"4.? PESTICIDE INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER STRESSORS									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Currently, bees are simultaneously dealing with multiple, potentially interacting, environmental stressors. Pesticide exposure combined with other stressors, e.g., parasites, nutritional stress, and climate change, can affect bee mortality, reproduction, behavior, and immune response antagonistically, additively, or synergistically. While most research to date has focused on honey bees, increasing evidence is emerging from non-Apis bee studies.									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Combined pesticide and pathogen exposure can sometimes, but not always, increase the severity of impacts on important endpoints for bumble bees (e.g., queen mortality, queen production, or worker learning performance) compared to the effects of either stressor alone. For example, foundress queens in bumble bee colonies exposed to neonicotinoids (clothianidin and thiamethoxam) and a trypanosome pathogen (Crithidia bombi) had reduced survival compared to those in colonies challenged by either stressor individually (54). However, while both neonicotinoid exposure or trypanosome infection reduced B. terrestris queen hibernation survival, there was no measurable additional or synergistic effect of combined exposure (53). Similarly, B. terrestris colonies exposed to lambda-cyhalothrin were not measurably more susceptible to trypanosome infections (16). Although B. terrestris workers infected by the microsporidian parasite Nosema ceranae were slower than uninfected controls to learn odor–reward associations, the learning performance of workers both exposed to clothianidin and infected by N. ceranae was measurably faster (134). Bombus terrestris colony performance is also impaired by exposure to different pesticides (neonicotinoids, pyrethroids, or EBI fungicides) combined with N. ceranae infection (29). Workers exposed to both the pyrethroid and fungicide had lower incidence of N. ceranae infection, perhaps because the fungal pathogen is impacted by the fungicide, and colonies exposed to thiamethoxam (singly or in combination) produced 40–76% fewer new queens (29).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Laboratory microcolony studies suggest that B. impatiens workers are highly tolerant to Nosema bombi infection, which was not significantly mitigated by chlorothalonil exposure, but workers both exposed to fungicide and infected with N. bombi carried more transmission-ready microsporidian spores (35). The prevalence of N. bombi infections appeared higher in some declining bumble bee compared to common bumble bee species in the United States (36), and greater total fungicide use was the best predictor of both N. bombi prevalence at a landscape scale and range contractions for declining Bombus species (118).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Both poor nutrition and pesticide exposure can have negative impacts on bees, which may be exacerbated by these factors occurring together. Although the effects of nutritionally poorer (monofloral) pollen diets were broadly overshadowed by impacts of imidacloprid exposure for B. impatiens queens (106), we know that restricted pollen diets can impact larval development (178). For example, Osmia cornifrons collected a more Rosaceae-dominated diet when foraging in more agriculturally dominated landscapes, which led to increased fungicide-related risk and reduced female offspring weight (38). The impacts of sulfoxaflor exposure on B. terrestris workers in microcolonies can be exacerbated in the presence of a sucrose-deficient diet that induces greater physiological stress and increases the amount of pesticide consumed (109). This nutritional stress either additively or synergistically exacerbated the negative effects of sulfoxaflor exposure on worker survival, egg laying, and larval production. Results from a semi-field cage study revealed strong additive effects of combined exposure to imidacloprid (soil drench) and low density of floral resources on O. lignaria reproduction (172), with combined pesticide exposure and food limitation reducing solitary bee reproduction by 57% ( Figure 3 ).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The distribution and diversity of flowers in a landscape affect the nutritional quality of bee diets, and providing additional floral resources in agricultural landscapes could improve diet quality; it could also either create further potential routes for pesticide exposure (27, 168, 196) or serve as a method to mitigate risks of such exposure (82, 93, 145). Flower plantings in Californian agricultural field margins supported greater reproduction by both O. lignaria and B. vosnesenskii (145). Perhaps unsurprisingly given their likely relative foraging ranges, O. lignaria was more heavily reliant on additional local flower plantings, while floral resources at the landscape level were more important for B. vosnesenskii. Bumble bee colony reproduction was impaired by high levels of pesticide exposure, but this effect was ameliorated by flower plantings (145).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Very few studies have considered pesticide and temperature interactions for non-Apis bees. Bombus terrestris workers orally exposed to imidacloprid showed a temperature-dependent decrease in distance flown at 30°C, compared to untreated controls, that was not seen at the lower temperatures tested (90). No measurable impacts of sulfoxaflor exposure on flight performance were reported at any of the temperatures tested.									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"5.? POLICY IMPLICATIONS, GAPS, AND FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pesticides make up one of the best-regulated groups of chemicals; before these products reach the market, they undergo ERAs, with bees being one of the non-target organisms assessed (158, 162). In several regions of the world, including Australia, Brazil, Europe, and North America, the pesticide ERA is a tiered approach in which mainly single-use pesticides are evaluated individually for exposure and effects in increasingly complicated, specific, and costly tiers (105, 130, 162). If concerns are triggered in the presumably more conservative and controlled lower tiers, then tests and assessments are moved to more environmentally realistic and specific higher tiers, all in relation to shared protection goals (25). These protection goals can be very broad and relate to general protection of biodiversity or formulated into more specific and operational protection goals (158). Such specific protection goals could be a reduction of a certain magnitude in the colony size of social bees or the population size of solitary bees (49). However, the definition and implementation of such protection goals are hindered by the limitations of our current knowledge and understanding of, as well as methods to track, exposure and impacts of pesticides for non-Apis bees.									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Both scientifically and in an ERA context, there are many potential gaps that could be addressed. Can taxonomic variation in pesticide sensitivity be accounted for with the use of safety factors in conjunction with honey bee toxicity data in ERAs, or are more tests on additional model species required? How can we scale from sublethal effects of pesticide exposure to individuals (and/or colonies where applicable) to population-level impacts? How do we make these connections between levels of organization and relevant spatiotemporal scales? How well do we know the relative importance of the pesticide stressor in relation to other stressors or factors for long-term bee population persistence? Answering these questions will require us to explore bees’ intrinsic sensitivity, capture landscape dynamics (e.g., source–sink dynamics, internal and external recovery processes), and better understand pesticides in relation to other stressors that impact bee taxa in different ways according to their lifestyles.									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5.1.?  Representativeness for the Bee Community									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The honey bee is used as an ERA model species under the assumption that findings related to exposure and effects for these bees can be extended to cover other bee taxa (60, 158), although the European Union has expanded their guidance on ERAs to include Bombus and Osmia (48). Discussions are ongoing about the need to diversify model species, with potential candidates including the handful of commercially available or managed bumble, solitary, and stingless bee species (30, 59, 69, 111, 153). In an ERA context, expansion to other species could be motivated by the desire to include exposure pathways that are not relevant to honey bees but could be relevant to the majority of other non-Apis species, e.g., pesticide residues in soil (58, 139, 199, 201), or model species that are more appropriate for determining and linking sublethal and population-level impacts under field conditions and in higher tiers (30, 34, 60, 104, 142). However, these potential candidates may not represent common traits of the bee community. For example, all except one of the commercially available solitary bee species are above-ground cavity nesters (Megachile or Osmia spp.), with the exception being the ground nester Nomia melanderi (153). Other suggestions for model species include the European O. brevicornis (78) and the North American E. pruinosa (201). From a scientific point of view, it is problematic that our understanding is limited to so few bee species and mostly to neonicotinoid insecticides (46), meaning that extrapolation to bees and pesticides in general is not yet possible. Therefore, expanding our methods and understanding beyond this limited set of species and insecticides should be a research priority. The taxonomic expansion could depart from the species vulnerability approach, in which species are vulnerable due to a combination of high exposure, intrinsic sensitivity, and little ability to recover (191). This approach has been used on a set of 10 bee species in an ERA context, and the conclusion was that the non-Apis species assessed were probably more vulnerable than honey bees, particularly in terms of exposure and ability to recover (149).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5.2.?  Exposure Pathways									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Given the diversity of bee species and lifestyles and how little we know about bees’ pesticide exposure, defining exposure pathways and scenarios for non-Apis bees that differ in their trait profiles represents an important area for further research. This could be explored, for example, using exposome or aggregate exposure pathway approaches; the former defines the lifetime environmental exposure, accounting for lifestyle variability (52), and the latter follows pesticides from the source of release, through the exposure medium, external exposure, and internal exposure, to targets of exposure inside the organism (179). Such approaches have yet to be applied to non-Apis bees.									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5.3.?  Effect Extrapolation									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Linking exposure to effects, both direct and indirect, as well as linking sub-individual or individual impacts to population or community effects and further to interspecific interactions, is another challenge. A potentially useful approach could be the use of adverse outcome pathways (5), which have been applied to B. impatiens and B. terrestris for neonicotinoids (37), or toxicokinetic–toxicodynamic modeling, which has so far only been applied to honey bees (12). Different modeling approaches have also been suggested for extrapolating across biological levels of organization and dealing with the protection of populations from exposure to multiple pesticides and other stressors (e.g., 12, 13, 15, 33, 92, 136, 187). However, the application to non-Apis bees has been limited, with a few exceptions that simulate how pesticides affect the development of bumble bee colonies (14, 19) or bee populations (94) in more or less realistic landscapes.									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Combining modeling with experimental studies is likely the only feasible way to account for both direct and indirect effects of pesticides on non-target organisms, both scientifically and in an ERA context (107). It is of critical importance to understand if and how pesticide use may put bees at risk; the answers to these questions have consequences for the long-term survival of bees and the pollination services they provide. From a global perspective, and in light of bee species richness and pesticide use patterns ( Figure 1 ), it would be particularly valuable to focus such studies on South America and other regions where bees and pesticides intersect heavily.									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Finally, to more holistically tackle the possible role of pesticide use in the decline of bees and other insects, along with the other factors that may have positive or negative effects on them, there is a need to look beyond ERAs of pesticides and to integrate regulations, strategies, and policies that often separately deal with threats to and support of bees (50). This would require removing regulatory silos to allow bee conservation to happen in concert with the regulatory and related processes of risk removal and pesticide use mitigation, for example, through access to abundant and diverse flower resources (82, 93, 145, 172, 204) and landscape-level access to semi-natural areas (96, 129, 139). This should help inform risk management options—such as where and when to provide additional floral plantings or allow pesticide use—and could form a component in integrated pollinator and pest management (22, 112) to remove or mitigate pesticide risks for non-target beneficial insects and simultaneously sustain and enhance pollination services to crop and non-crop plants.

"ABSTRACT
 
Bees are essential pollinators of many crops and wild plants, and pesticide exposure is one of the key environmental stressors affecting their health in anthropogenically modified landscapes. Until recently, almost all information on routes and impacts of pesticide exposure came from honey bees, at least partially because they were the only model species required for environmental risk assessments (ERAs) for insect pollinators. Recently, there has been a surge in research activity focusing on pesticide exposure and effects for non-Apis bees, including other social bees (bumble bees and stingless bees) and solitary bees. These taxa vary substantially from honey bees and one another in several important ecological traits, including spatial and temporal activity patterns, foraging and nesting requirements, and degree of sociality. In this article, we review the current evidence base about pesticide exposure pathways and the consequences of exposure for non-Apis bees. We find that the insights into non-Apis bee pesticide exposure and resulting impacts across biological organizations, landscapes, mixtures, and multiple stressors are still in their infancy. The good news is that there are many promising approaches that could be used to advance our understanding, with priority given to informing exposure pathways, extrapolating effects, and determining how well our current insights (limited to very few species and mostly neonicotinoid insecticides under unrealistic conditions) can be generalized to the diversity of species and lifestyles in the global bee community. We conclude that future research to expand our knowledge would also be beneficial for ERAs and wider policy decisions concerning pollinator conservation and pesticide regulation.

1.? INTRODUCTION
 
Under the looming shadow of a sixth mass extinction of species (41), with mounting evidence of declines in terrestrial arthropods (73, 152, 190, 194, 195), there is an urgent need to understand the unintended impacts of pesticide use for non-target arthropods. Despite substantial research and policy focus on this issue for bees over the past two decades, much of our understanding of the routes and impacts of pesticide exposure has come from honey bees (Apis mellifera) (186). This is primarily driven by their use as an insect pollinator model species for regulatory pesticide risk assessments, motivated by their convenience for ecotoxicological testing (30, 60, 69) and interests in bee products and crop pollination. However, honey bee ecology and life history are atypical for bees. In contrast, the majority of the approximately 20,000 bee species worldwide do not live in perennial, social colonies in cavities, but are instead solitary, and many species spend most of their life developing and living in soil (44).

The honey bee may be no more or less sensitive to the direct effects of pesticides than other bees or even insects more generally (9, 74). However, when considering bees in their ecological or (non)social context, there is an emerging understanding that honey bees may not represent pesticide use consequences for the vast majority of solitary bee species (44); the approximately 250 bumble bee species that are social for only part of their life cycle (61); or the approximately 600 stingless bee species that, like honey bees, live in perennial, social colonies (71). Recent years have seen increased focus on routes and impacts of pesticide exposure for these non-Apis bee species, even if most studies are focused on a limited set of species that can be kept in captivity and on the impacts of neonicotinoid insecticides (42, 159).

In this review, we shine a light on the current understanding of pesticide exposure and its effects for non-Apis bees, singly and in combination with other environmental stressors, from individual to population and ecosystem consequences, and from the laboratory to the field. We approach bee diversity and consequences of pesticide use through a lens of ecological traits, since such traits are anticipated to modify the bees’ pesticide exposure and subsequent impacts. These traits include the seasonal phenology of their activity (flight) period during the year, diurnal activity patterns, floral preferences (lecty), nesting ecology (including construction materials and location), degree of sociality, individual or colony longevity, foraging range, and mobility in the landscape (32, 87, 153, 180, 188, 202). Furthermore, we consider pesticide effects combined with other environmental stressors, including land-use intensification (and related habitat loss and fragmentation); climate change; and the spread of alien species, pathogens, and diseases (103, 135, 192). We end by highlighting important areas of future research and reflecting on the environmental risk assessment (ERA) of pesticides and the wider policy context relevant to bee conservation and pesticide regulation.

 
2.? PESTICIDE EXPOSURE
 
Pesticide exposure pathways emerge from the spatiotemporal intersection between bee activity patterns and pesticide contamination of the landscape—the latter resulting from pesticide use and fate [conceptualized by Sponsler et al. (162)]. It is therefore essential to understand both spatial and temporal patterns of pesticide use, accounting for distribution and degradation, as well as where bees occupy the landscape, i.e., their habitat use, over their life cycle and how they use and come into contact with different materials to understand bee pesticide exposure. On a global scale, high bee species richness (128) and greater pesticide use on cropland (177) co-occur in South and North America and the Mediterranean regions ( Figure 1 ). Such spatial co-occurrence could indicate the potential for substantial pesticide exposure for a significant part of these bee communities. Bees can be exposed to pesticides throughout their life cycle—during foraging, nest construction, brood care, and hibernation and through either oral (nectar, pollen, water, or honeydew) or contact (air, plants, propolis or resin, wax, or soil) exposure—with exposure being species and life stage dependent (30). We illustrate these different pesticide exposure pathways among bees and influences of nesting and foraging habits in Figure 2 .

Colored sections of the annual rings (midsummer at the top) around the bee species images show when bumble bee queens and nesting female solitary bees are active (red), when adult workers are active (yellow), and when there is no adult activity (gray). Arrows in the diagram show routes of exposure via crop (yellow), non-crop herbaceous (green), and non-crop woody (blue) plants. The width of the arrows is roughly proportional to relative exposure, and the length of the arrows is roughly proportional to the foraging ranges from central nest locations.

2.1.?  Relative Importance of Exposure Pathways Varies Across Bee Taxa
Oral exposure to pesticide residues via the consumption and transportation of nectar and pollen, by adults foraging either for their own needs or to provision their offspring, is common to all bee taxa. Larval exposure likely depends on whether females provide mass provisions (solitary and stingless bees) or sequentially feed their brood (honey and bumble bees) (44, 61, 71). Mass provisions for a single brood cell might be collected within a few hours or a day, representing a discrete snapshot of potential environmental pesticide exposure. Thus, the extent and magnitude of pesticide exposure could vary among brood cells within a nest or colony if they were provisioned at different times. In contrast, the larvae of sequentially provisioned species will be exposed to potentially fluctuating pesticide residues in nectar and pollen over the collection and colony storage periods. Honey bee larvae are fed brood food (secretions from nurse bees’ hypopharyngeal and mandibular glands) that may differ in terms of pesticide residues from the nectar and pollen collected due to detoxification and processing by nurse bees (21).

Pesticide residues in water represent a possible route of exposure for adult bees from most taxa, although the likelihood of exposure is much greater for honey or stingless bee workers that regularly collect water for nest thermoregulation (30, 39). Bumble bees and the majority of solitary bees rarely, if ever, specifically collect water, instead obtaining what they need from nectar (69, 153). Collection of sugary exudates from homopteran (honeydew) or plant (guttation fluid) sources represents a potential exposure route for honey, bumble, and stingless bee workers, with honeydew representing the more important exposure pathway for Apis and stingless bees, for whom guttation fluid is less important (30, 39, 71).

Contact exposure to pesticide residues in the air likely represents a common route of exposure for all adult bees (regardless of species) as they fly around the environment (30), although the extent and relative risks of exposure will depend on spatiotemporal patterns of both pesticide use and activity by different taxa. Similar to air, contact exposure to pesticide residues on plants is likely to be a consistent route of exposure across bee taxa, particularly for bees foraging on treated crops in agricultural landscapes and for male solitary or bumble bees, which rest among plants instead of returning to a nest overnight. Adult female bees, particularly solitary leafcutting bees, are also likely to experience oral (but not dietary) exposure through plant material (e.g., leaf or petal pieces) that they collect to line and/or separate brood cells (97). Contact exposure for developing larvae and (pre)pupae is also likely to represent a more significant route of exposure for leafcutting bees than for the brood of other bee taxa. Many bee taxa collect oils and resins from plants to incorporate into their nest structure (e.g., stingless, honey, and many solitary bee species) and/or for the creation of scents (e.g., male euglossine bees). Contact with pesticide residues via resin is likely a more important route of exposure for stingless bees, which use these plant exudates extensively, followed by honey bees (which turn resins into propolis) and bumble bees and some solitary bees (30). Honey, bumble, and stingless bees secrete and manipulate wax for nest construction, with adults and larvae coming into contact with these structures for weeks, months, or years. Lipophilic pesticide residues are more likely to accumulate in such wax structures (120), creating the potential for both acute and chronic contact exposure for these bee taxa.

2.2.?  Nesting Habits Influence Bees’ Pesticide Exposure
Solitary ground-nesting species account for approximately 75% of the estimated 20,000 bee species worldwide (6); thus, extended periods of contact with soil likely represent an important route of exposure to pesticide residues (58, 153, 199). While excavating nests in the ground, adult females can dig through and move many hundreds of times their own body mass in soil (199). Offspring could come into contact with pesticides in soil used to create their brood cell throughout their development from egg, to larva, to pupa, with exposure duration potentially being long-lasting (2, 3, 201). Pesticide exposure through soil has also been suggested for some solitary and stingless bee species that use mud for nest construction (39, 153) and bumble bee queens that hibernate underground (139). Both solitary and stingless bees use a diversity of nesting places and materials, which, in addition to soil and mud, make resins, petals, leaves, stems, and wood potentially relevant for their exposure pathways (39, 153).

The extent to which pesticides in soil can penetrate the larval or adult cuticle is currently unknown. Secretions and modifications to the linings of brood cells (e.g., those produced by cellophane bees) could also affect such rates of transfer and cuticular penetration by pesticides. At this time, the extent to which such brood cell linings vary among bee taxa and how this trait variation might affect pesticide exposure scenarios are unknown. However, simply focusing on exposure through materials is not enough, since the frequency of encountering the materials and the duration and extent of contact or consumption of them, as well as uptake and toxicity, also matter. Willis Chan et al. (199) provide an example of how these many aspects could be combined for ground-nesting solitary bees to estimate pesticide risk and conclude that, for this group of bees, soil is an important route of exposure, driven mainly by the amount of soil that the female handles and ingests during nest construction.

2.3.?  Foraging Habits Influence Bees’ Pesticide Exposure
Most bees are central place foragers (for more or less all of their adult lives), collecting nectar and pollen from flowers in their surroundings and bringing these resources back to their central nest. Bees’ foraging ranges are thus an integral part of their ecology (88), and the spatial arrangement among nests and flowers determines how bees are distributed across the landscape and therefore their pesticide exposure. Bees can be exposed when they are foraging on treated crops in bloom (70, 142) but also through non-crop plants within or beyond treated fields when pesticides drift and leach into the surroundings (27, 110, 168). Taxon-specific foraging ranges and preferences for different crops and non-crop habitats (138, 145), in combination with crop- and landscape-specific pesticide use patterns, result in variation in exposure among bees (30, 39, 126, 162, 188) ( Figure 2 ).

Exposure patterns likely depend on key traits shared within groups of species or functional guilds. For example, it has been suggested that species that forage over larger areas are more extensively exposed to pesticides compared to species with more limited foraging ranges because the former exploit large but widely scattered resource patches (96), which in agricultural landscapes are often made up of pesticide-treated flowering crops. Honey bees collect a substantial amount of their pollen from oilseed rape and fruit crops (117, 193), in contrast to Osmia spp. solitary bees, which favor non-crop, predominantly woody, pollen sources (131, 145) ( Figure 2 ). Thus, exposure patterns are also likely to be tempered by diet breadth, with specialist species being more predictably linked to the residue profiles of their particular forage plants, for example, Eucera pruinosa to cucurbits (200) and Osmia brevicornis to brassicas (78). A similar relationship seems likely for the temporal scale of activity, with taxa with longer active flight periods (e.g., stingless bee colonies) likely being exposed to more variable pesticide exposure scenarios (87).

2.4.?  Pesticide Mixtures and Life Cycle Exposure Across Landscapes
Bees encounter pesticides in the environment as mixtures, a fact that is well established for honey bees and increasingly obvious for non-Apis bees (e.g., 20, 28, 45, 70, 96, 114, 115, 126, 145, 196). Such mixture exposure can come from intentional tank mixtures of pesticides but most often can be attributed to the differential habitats and materials used by bees, resulting from their nesting and foraging habits (30, 181). Pesticide-treated cropland, particularly including orchard and vegetable crops, can increase both the amount and diversity of pesticides that bees are exposed to through nectar, pollen, and soil compared to diversified farmland containing more semi-natural areas (70, 96, 126, 139, 199). Pesticide exposure patterns are therefore expected to be landscape context dependent, and this dependence may vary among bee taxa (96). For example, Botías et al. (28) found that specimens of five bumble bee species contained higher frequencies and concentrations of pesticides in agricultural compared to urban environments. However, the underlying drivers of exposure in different bee species and contexts is not well understood, even though this understanding is essential for both predicting pesticide effects and developing strategies for risk mitigation (162, 188).

A more holistic view of bee life cycle and activity patterns, combined with information on different pesticide residues in multiple bee species and relevant materials collected simultaneously in several places and time points, would enhance our understanding of pathways for mixture exposure. Such studies are beginning to accumulate (e.g., 86, 174, 196, 199) but are not yet sufficient for general conclusions. Ward et al. (196) found that pesticide concentrations were highest in flowers and lowest in soil and similar between wild and honey bees, while Willis Chan et al. (199) concluded that insecticide concentrations were similar in soil and pollen but that there were higher maximum concentrations in soil. In European agricultural soils (2005–2009), the most frequently detected insecticide was DDT, at concentrations up to 5,830 ng/g soil, and 7% of the samples contained imidacloprid, the only screened neonicotinoid, at concentrations up to 60 ng/g (155).

 
3.? PESTICIDE EFFECTS
 
Pesticide exposure provides only part of the puzzle, and it is not until we consider the consequences of exposure that we can draw any conclusions about the possible harm that pesticide use may cause for bees. Until relatively recently, an apparent mismatch existed between laboratory studies (under more controlled conditions) on (sub)individual levels showing impacts of pesticide exposure and results from field studies (measuring responses from agricultural use patterns in landscapes) showing limited impacts (60, 156). This was particularly true for studies of sublethal exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides, for which abundant evidence of impacts existed from laboratory studies and few, if any, measurable impacts of exposure had been found under semi-field or field conditions (66–68, 113). Studies focusing on non-Apis bee species over the past 10–15 years have been critical to bridge and resolve these apparent mismatches (104, 186).

3.1.?  Lethal Effects on Individuals and Relative Sensitivity Across Bee Taxa
Mortality and lifespan effects of acute and chronic exposure during different life stages, including those found by dose-response studies, can vary substantially among both bee taxa and pesticides. Expanding lethal endpoint studies (e.g., LD/LC50 estimation) to non-Apis taxa has provided important insights on taxonomic variation in sensitivity (9). For example, A. mellifera can be 1,000 times more sensitive to acute oral exposure (24 h) to acephate (organophosphate) than B. terrestris (47), and Nannotrigona perilampoides can be 2,085 times more sensitive to acute contact exposure (24 h) to thiacloprid (neonicotinoid) than A. mellifera (83, 189). Even restricting comparisons to those between honey and bumble bees, perhaps the next most-studied bee taxon after A. mellifera, differences in sensitivity appear to be inconsistent. For example, imidacloprid is 2,058 times more toxic to bumble bees than carbaryl (carbamate) in contact toxicity assays, imidacloprid is three times more toxic to bumble than to honey bees, and carbaryl is 49 times more toxic to honey than to bumble bees (147). Such differences in relative sensitivity have also been seen in comparisons of acute oral toxicity for different insecticides—sulfoxaflor (sulfoximine) and thiamethoxam (neonicotinoid) are 8.3 times and 3.3 times, respectively, more acutely toxic to Bombus impatiens than to A. mellifera, whereas flupyradifurone (butenolide) is more acutely toxic to A. mellifera than to B. impatiens (121).

The intrinsic sensitivity of B. terrestris and Osmia bicornis to neonicotinoids appears to be determined by the activity of certain cytochrome P450 enzymes of the CYP9Q subfamily (18, 116), with species lacking these enzymes showing greater sensitivity (76). For example, Megachile rotundata lacks such P450 enzymes and is 170 to over 2,500 times more sensitive to acute contact exposure compared to other tested bee species (76). Such interspecific differences in detoxification ability for certain pesticides could also explain the substantially greater sensitivity of M. rotundata to contact pyrethroid exposure compared to B. impatiens and Osmia lignaria (53–68 times; 151). There is, however, very little known about how this detoxification capacity generalizes beyond this handful of species.

As with honey bees, there is also substantial variation in the relative toxicity of different pesticides for non-Apis bees. For example, thiamethoxam is at least 1,133 times more toxic to B. impatiens than another systemic insecticide, flupyradifurone (121), and the biopesticide spinosad is 1.95 times more toxic than imidacloprid to Melipona quadrifasciata (182). The lethal toxicity of different neonicotinoids varied substantially for Tetragonisca angustula, with N-nitroguanidine compounds (imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) being up to 193 times more toxic than the N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoids (acetamiprid and thiacloprid) (84). A recent comparison of acute oral thiamethoxam toxicity suggested that all three stingless bee species (Melipona scutellaris, Scaptotrigona postica, and T. angustula) tested were 6.6–127.6 times more sensitive than A. mellifera (111). However, A. mellifera was 2.4 times more sensitive to oral imidacloprid exposure than Partamona helleri (184), while this stingless species was 797 times more susceptible than honey bees to deltamethrin (pyrethroid).

Body size can be an important factor influencing both intra- and interspecific sensitivity of bees to pesticides (108, 149). For example, both B. terrestris and O. bicornis showed intraspecific variation in sensitivity to sulfoxaflor and Amistar (azoxystrobin fungicide; 108). Although bee weight was a useful predictor of pesticide sensitivity, this alone could not explain observed variability between sexes and castes. Although three stingless bee species tested were consistently more sensitive to thiamethoxam than honey bees, the relative order of stingless bee species sensitivity was different if body mass was taken into account (111).

Given the substantial interspecific variability in lethal toxicity for bees exposed to individual pesticides shown to date, more research is warranted to further determine which model species (in addition to A. mellifera), safety factors, and other measures should be considered in ERAs for pesticides. In the real world, bees (and other insect pollinators) are most likely exposed to combinations of multiple pesticides, making understanding mixture toxicity essential (23, 65, 77, 80, 137, 147). Clearly, it is important to determine whether exposure to such mixtures produces antagonistic, additive, or synergistic impacts on toxicity and how this might vary among bee taxa. For example, the lethal toxicity of clothianidin (neonicotinoid) for B. terrestris and O. bicornis can be substantially and synergistically increased (approximately three times) when combined with propiconazole (SBI fungicide) (137).

It is also worth considering potential differences in toxicity between specific pesticide active ingredients (AIs) and the proprietary formulations used in agriculture, which can contain multiple AIs along with other co-formulants (surfactants, wetting agents, etc.). In some cases, the toxicity of proprietary formulations can be caused by co-formulants—for example, co-formulants in Roundup products (rather than the glyphosate herbicide AI) appear to represent a substantial lethal risk to bumble bees by matting body hair and possibly overwhelming the gas exchange system (170).

3.2.?  Information About Sublethal Effects on Individuals, and Our Mechanistic Understanding of Their Consequences, Hinges on Studies of Non-Apis Species
Real-world pesticide exposure should occur at levels substantially below lethal thresholds for bee taxa. However, pesticides (particularly insecticides) designed to impair the normal function of pests can also have sublethal impacts on the physiology and behavior of non-target organisms, including bees. Studies of non-Apis bees, particularly bumble bees exposed to neonicotinoid insecticides, have been critical in developing our understanding of sublethal impacts of exposure on individual bees (and how they affect bumble bee colony function) and a mechanistic understanding of their wider consequences for populations (Section 3.3) and pollination (Section 3.4).

Consumption of pesticide-contaminated nectar by bumble bees can lead to reductions in the amount and rate of feeding (antifeedant effects) (29, 100–102; C.G. Strang, S. Rondeau, N. Baert, S. McArt, N.E. Raine and F. Muth, unpublished manuscript), preferences for consuming neonicotinoid-treated sugar solution (8, 91; but see 123), and impairment of associative learning (132, 161, 167) and spatial working memory (146). However, while exposure to thiamethoxam or imidacloprid can lead to impaired bumble bee learning and memory (but see 122), workers exposed to another neonicotinoid (clothianidin) (133) or sulfoxaflor (160) showed no measurable effects—despite all of these insecticides having the same mode of action (targeting nicotinic acetylcholine receptors).

Bumble bee flight (89, 90) and foraging performance (7, 55, 64, 65, 163, 166) can be impaired by neonicotinoid consumption. Neonicotinoid-exposed bumble bee workers can have reduced motivation to forage (98, 122), altered floral preferences (64, 164), and impaired flower handling skills (164, 175, 198); collect pollen less frequently and in smaller loads (55, 64, 65, 166); and perform longer foraging trips (166). Shortfalls in individual pollen foraging performance can be buffered to some extent at the colony level by more workers going out to forage when bumble bees are exposed to either imidacloprid (64, 65) or thiamethoxam (166). Pollen collection by solitary bees can also be affected by pesticide exposure, with female E. pruinosa collecting 5.3 times less cucurbit pollen when exposed to imidacloprid (201), as well as collecting 32% less pollen per visit and spending 24% less time handling squash flowers when exposed to the fungicide Quadris Top—a mix of azoxystrobin and difenoconazole (S. Rondeau and N.E. Raine, unpublished manuscript). Imidacloprid exposure also appears to affect color preferences and decrease locomotion in the stingless bee P. helleri (1).

Although there is some evidence that honey bee homing and navigation performance can be affected by neonicotinoid exposure (56), there is less convincing evidence for non-Apis bees. Solitary O. cornuta bees exposed to clothianidin were less able to learn how to navigate by walking to a feeding site under laboratory conditions (85), and more worker bumble bees from imidacloprid- or thiamethoxam-exposed colonies failed to return from presumed foraging trips (64, 65, 166). However, results from remote releases of bumble bees exposed to thiamethoxam revealed that a higher proportion of workers from pesticide-treated colonies returned from 1 km, with no measurable impact of pesticide exposure on homing performance over 2 km or when all data were analyzed together (166).

Pesticide exposure can also affect the motivation and performance of non-Apis bees in excavating underground nests (201), recognizing nest locations (10), and locating potential hibernation sites (S. Rondeau and N.E. Raine, unpublished manuscript). Eucera pruinosa females exposed to imidacloprid established 85% fewer nests than untreated controls in a semi-field enclosure experiment (201). Contact exposure to the fungicides Rovral 4F (iprodione) and Pristine (pyraclostrobin and boscalid mixture) and their adjuvant (N-90, a non-ionic wetting agent consisting of 90% polyethoxylated nonylphenol) sprayed onto vegetation in cage studies disrupted nest cavity recognition for M. rotundata females (10). Cavity-nesting O. lignaria bees exposed to imidacloprid-treated soil also showed impaired nesting activity—although this occurred at higher levels of exposure (?390 ppb; 58). Interestingly, soil moisture had substantial impacts on female mortality, with no mortality at 20% compared to >50% mortality at 40% soil moisture irrespective of pesticide exposure level (58). Osmia lignaria females showed no evidence of avoiding imidacloprid-treated soils for nesting material even when faced with a choice between soils with 0 and 1,000 ppb (57). Bombus impatiens queens are substantially more likely to choose pesticide-treated soils when seeking hibernation sites (S. Rondeau and N.E. Raine, unpublished manuscript). Queens showed a preference for all five pesticides used in this choice experiment, including two fungicides (boscalid and difenoconazole) and two different classes of insecticide (neonicotinoids and diamides), over pesticide-free soil. Survival of B. terrestris queens was significantly reduced over a 4-month hibernation period following oral exposure to a mixture of clothianidin and thiamethoxam, and surviving queens exposed to these pesticides lost more weight during hibernation than untreated controls (53). In contrast, hibernation survival of B. impatiens queens exposed to soil treated with either diamide insecticides (chlorantraniliprole and cyantraniliprole) or fungicides (boscalid and difenoconazole), singly or in combination, was not adversely affected (S. Rondeau and N.E. Raine, unpublished manuscript).

Colony establishment by bumble bee queens can also be impaired by pesticide exposure. Exposure to thiamethoxam led to a reduction in terminal oocyte length in queens of four different Bombus species (17) and a 26% reduction in the proportion of B. terrestris queens that laid eggs and advanced the timing of colony initiation (15). Similar patterns were observed for B. impatiens queens exposed to a range of imidacloprid concentrations (0.3–25 ppb), with dose-dependent queen mortality, weight loss, dramatically reduced activity levels, and delays in egg laying and nest initiation (106, 207). Exposure to boscalid residues in soil doubled the likelihood of B. impatiens queens surviving through the colony initiation period (after successful hibernation) and laying eggs (S. Rondeau and N.E. Raine, unpublished manuscript).

Bumble bee colony growth can be impaired by exposure to neonicotinoid (33, 40, 51, 54, 64, 65, 99, 197) or sulfoxaflor (157) insecticides and the landscape exposure created by agricultural pesticide use (126) but appeared to be unaffected by chlorantraniliprole sprayed onto flowering turf grass (99). Chronic dietary exposure to neonicotinoids can lead to consumption of less food, production of fewer workers with truncated production, reduced worker longevity, and larger worker size in B. terrestris (40, 54, 165). Queens in imidacloprid-treated colonies are more inactive and spend less time on brood care (40). Imidacloprid exposure also impairs brood care by B. impatiens workers, affects spatial and social dynamics in the colony, and impairs colony thermoregulation (43). Consumption of artificial nectar, activity levels, and thoracic temperature were all reduced in O. bicornis orally exposed to imidacloprid but not measurably affected by exposure to other neonicotinoids [acetamiprid (11) or clothianidin (125)] or a triazole fungicide [myclobutanil (11)]. Contact exposure to imidacloprid-treated soil led to species- and sex-specific impacts on speed of larval development and adult longevity in O. lignaria and M. rotunda",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Introduction									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pesticides can have negative impacts on individual bees and bee colonies when toxic products are applied to blooming plants that are bee attractive (Botías et al., 2017; Chauzat et al., 2010; Kiljanek et al., 2017; Tosi et al., 2018; Graham et al., 2021). Bees can become exposed to pesticide residues when foraging on pesticide-treated plants, which can result in mortality if the residues are at levels that are acutely toxic to them. Mortality, however, may be lessened if the pesticide is applied in the evening, when bees are not foraging. Theoretically, this allows for an interval over which the pesticide can dissipate on the plant sufficiently to become relatively non-toxic to bees when they resume foraging the next day (Johansen et al., 1983a; Johansen et al., 1983b). Evening pesticide applications as a way to mitigate exposure, however, are predicated on the assumption that the residues of the pesticides will weather sufficiently before bees resume foraging the next morning and come into contact with treated leaves and flowers (Barmaz, Potts & Vighi, 2010; Fischer & Moriarty, 2011; The Honey Bee Health Coalition, 2019; Smodiš Škerl et al., 2009).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The rate at which acute toxicity of pesticides to bees dissipates from plant surfaces is known as the pesticide’s residual time. Pesticide registrants in the U.S. are required to estimate the residual time for all formulated pesticides that contain one or more active ingredients that is acutely toxic to bees (i.e., acute contact toxicity lethal dose to 50% of the honey bees (LD50) is less than 11 micrograms of pesticide per bee) and the use pattern indicates that bees are likely to be exposed (40 CFR 158.630(d)). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides guidance for registrants on how to conduct a trial to estimate residual time (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2012a). These trials involve spraying a field crop (typically alfalfa) with a pesticide, allowing residues to weather for set intervals, then harvesting plant material and placing it in a cage with honey bees (Apis mellifera). The bees are free to walk over the plant material for a set period of time (typically 24 h), after which the number of dead bees is counted. Residual time is expressed as the weathering interval after which the mortality of bees contacting the foliage reaches 25% mortality (referred to as the residual time to 25% mortality or RT25). The basic pattern of these trials pre-dates EPA guidelines and have been used by toxicologists since the 1960s (e.g., Wiese, 1962). Notably, this approach does not take into account the time taken for a systemic pesticide to no longer be present in nectar and pollen, which is addressed elsewhere in the EPA’s risk assessment for bees (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2016)									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A key threshold residual time identified by the EPA is known as extended residual toxicity. A pesticide with extended residual toxicity is one that cannot be applied safely in the evening as residues would cause more than 25% mortality of bees in a cage assay. Although the residual time threshold is not specified in the EPA’s Label Review Manual (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2012b); elsewhere, the EPA indicates that a pesticide with extended residual toxicity has RT25 >8 h (Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, 2012). Typically, pesticide labels in the U.S. only indicate whether pesticides that are acutely toxic to bees have extended residual toxicity or not and generally do not list RT25 values (Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, 2012).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"RT25 is an important tool in determining how to best mitigate the risk of bee exposure to pesticides residues. The importance of RT25 estimates for pesticide applicators when selecting and applying a pesticide is evinced by state Cooperative Extension publications that list RT25 values from published studies (e.g., Hooven, Sagili & Johansen, 2013). Furthermore, RT25 estimates are used by the EPA in order to characterize the hazards and risks of pesticides to pollinating insects. The EPA requires that a product’s residual toxicity to bees be communicated on the product label in a way that is reflective of the RT25 value. The EPA has produced guidance for their reviewers and pesticide registrants on the language they will typically suggest for different RT25 values (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2012b). This information will typically be available in the Environmental Hazards section of the label, but it is not federally enforceable and is used as an informational tool for pesticide applicators (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2012b). However, pesticide labels rarely state the RT25 value, so this information is not readily accessible to pesticide applicators, crop advisors or extension educators. There remains a demand for better guidance on the dissipation rates of bee toxic products under field conditions.									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Notably, more recent EPA guidance (United States Protection Agency, 2017) provides more specific mitigation language around the extended residual toxicity threshold for the safe application of pesticides during bee pollination. These new guidelines provide federally enforceable specific use instructions for residual toxicity stating that if extended residual toxicity (residues persisting for greater than 8 h i.e., extended residual toxicity) is not present for a pesticide it can be applied 2 h before sunset when pollinators are least active (United States Protection Agency, 2017). Pesticide registrants have begun adopting this guidance, one example is Harvanta 50SL (Summit Agro™, Durham, NC, EPA registration number 71512-26-88783), which states for fruiting vegetables (Crop Group 8-10) “foliar application of this product is prohibited to a crop from onset of flowering until flowering is complete unless the application is being made in the time period between 2 h prior to sunset until sunrise”. While this shows that some labels have been written in accordance with this new policy, many pesticide labels still follow pre-2017 guidance in communicating residual toxicity to bees (e.g., Product Dursban 50W, EPA Registration Number 62719-72; Product Merit 2F, EPA Registration Number 432-1312, which states: “do not apply this product or allow it to drift to blooming crops or weeds if bees are visiting the treatment area”). In addition to the 2017 guidance, the EPA released a public summary of RT25 estimates compiled from registrant-submitted data to the public (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2014). Notably, the summary only included studies that have “undergone quality assurance reviews to ensure that the data are scientifically sound”, and, in turn, is missing several widely used active ingredients (e.g., bifenthrin). Regardless, the omissions pose a challenge to researchers looking to compare pesticide label language on residual toxicity to RT25 values. 									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There is a need to investigate pesticide label language against studies that characterize environmental risks. Bucy & Melathopoulos (2020), for example, found that roughly 32% of pesticide labels analyzed had at least one error in the communication of acute toxicity to bees, or the adverse effects caused after a short exposure time to an active ingredient (OCSPP 850.3000). These authors, however, were unable to do a similar analysis with residual toxicity statements because of the absence of a comprehensive database of RT25 values. 									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Our objective was to provide the first analysis of pesticide label statements communicating residual toxicity to bees in comparison to actual RT25 values. The overall reason for doing this is to ensure that residual toxicity information is correctly communicated to pesticide applicators on labels. We approached the challenges experienced by Bucy & Melathopoulos (2020) by creating a database of RT25 values to compare to pesticide label statements. Our approach to creating a database was to assemble all published residual toxicity studies and characterize variability in methodologies used to assess residual toxicity. We then conducted a systematic review to calculate RT25 estimates for each pesticide and validated these estimates against values published by EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2014). We used the validated database to analyze the residual toxicity statement on pesticide labels and to determine how RT25 estimates vary by the rate of pesticide used, the formulation of the pesticide, and bee species.

"Portions of this manuscript were previously published as part of a preprint (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.05.543089v1.full). We located putative residual toxicity studies using Web of Science with the search term “residual toxicity” as well as the names of bee taxa commonly used in residual toxicity assays and currently listed in EPA’s RT25 database: “Apis”, “Nomia” and “Megachile”. This search returned a total of 130 studies. Next, we located residual toxicity studies on the alfalfa leafcutting bee (Megachile rotundata) from proceedings of the Western Alfalfa Seed Growers Association (2004-2017), resulting in an additional 17 studies. We also evaluated a series of Bee Research Investigation and Integrated Pest and Pollinator Investigation reports released by Washington State University amounting to 28 reports. Finally, we obtained 8 studies directly from Bayer CropSciences. In sum, we evaluated 183 residual toxicity studies. Databases were last searched in 2022. We narrowed these studies down to 50 by only including studies that met any of the following criteria: (1) the study was a primary source of data (e.g., not a review paper); (2) bees were exposed to the pesticide applied to on plant material (e.g., no studies where pesticide was applied to filter paper); and/or, (3) the study focused on residual toxicity of pesticides applied to plots of crop plants and involved harvesting plant tissue for caged bees. These criteria were designed to ensure that we only included studies whose residual toxicity methodology broadly followed those of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (2016). We removed two additional studies because the author indicated that it was likely that some live bees in the assay were mistakenly counted as dead (Johansen, Kious & Mayer, 1981) and because the actual active ingredient of the product used was not specified (Walsh et al., 2011).

"Evaluation of studies									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This analysis consisted of residual toxicity studies where a pesticide was foliar applied onto a specific crop, and the plant material (e.g., foliage) was harvested at varying time intervals after application. The plant material was then collected and placed in cages with adult bees to contact for 24 h or longer. Residual toxicity was calculated from variation in bee mortality for bees exposed to plant material harvested at different intervals of weathering. We defined each time interval that plant material was collected at as one trial. Although studies were selected based on their broad adherence with the methodology developed by (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2016), they varied across several test parameters. We categorized the variance from EPA methodology across four key study parameters (Table 1).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"We used the following approaches to standardize methodologies across studies. The EPA uses the word “young” to describe the optimal age of bees for residual toxicity trials. We interpreted “young” to mean newly emerged adult (eclosed) bees that were less than 1 day of age (Winston, 1991). Furthermore, when a study reported a range for a parameter, such as for number of bees per cage or temperature, we used the average calculated from the low and high points of the range. In reference to the diet that the bees were fed during the assay, one study reported the syrup concentration as 91:1 (wt:wt) which we assumed was 1:1 (Mayer, 2001).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We evaluated whether parameters in studies aligned with EPA recommendations, by counting each testing parameter as described in ‘Evaluation of studies’. We noted whether studies had test parameters that corresponded to those recommended by the EPA or if there was not enough information to determine correspondence.									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Calculation of RT25 values									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Very few studies report RT25 values, instead reported the number of bees alive or dead at different time intervals. In order to compare the values in these studies to EPA’s RT25 values we used the mortality data from different time intervals to estimate RT25. Trials within studies were compiled by active ingredient, the formulation of the pesticide product (emulsifiable concentrate, wettable powder, etc.), application rate, the species of bee used in the cage assay and the duration residues were allowed to weather. We removed any trials with only a single weathering period because these could not be used to calculate residual time. We also removed studies if they did not specify application rates, or percentage mortality and if mixtures of active ingredients were used. The EPA includes both M. rotundata and N. melanderi as well as A. mellifera in their published RT25 values but not Bombus. Consequently, we also removed Bombus trials from this analysis since comparison to the EPA would have been impossible.									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We used R statistical software (v4.1.1; R Core Team, 2021) along with the package Tidyverse (Wickham et al., 2019) to calculate the RT25 values using regression models where time was the independent variable and percent mortality the dependent variable. We checked for overdispersion in all assays. If the data was not over dispersed, we then calculated the RT25 values through a binomial logistic regression. If the data was over dispersed, we calculated the RT25 values using a quasibinomial logistic regression.									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Comparison of RT25 values									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We validated the database created from calculated RT25 values (‘Calculation of RT25 values’) by comparing residual times for each active ingredient by application rate, formulation of the product (i.e., emulsifiable concentrate, wettable powder, etc.), and species of bee in the database published by the EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2014). Instead of comparing the RT25 estimates themselves, we compared how each database would categorize a pesticide as having extended residual toxicity or not. For example, if our calculated RT25 value for a pesticide was less than 6 h (i.e., no extended residual toxicity) and EPA indicated the RT25 value was greater than 12 h (i.e., extended residual toxicity), we deemed the two as sufficiently different. Furthermore, we assumed EPA database estimates were accurate. If extended residual toxicity determinations matched those of pesticides from our systematic review, this would mean that we could rely on RT25 estimates for active ingredients that did not appear in the EPA database. In contrast, if there were substantial misalignment among extended residual toxicity determinations between our calculated and USEPA RT25 estimates, we would conclude that our calculation methods significantly differed from EPA’s and our estimates would need to be reevaluated.									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We compared RT25 values for bee species across active ingredient, formulation, and application rate. M. rotundata and N. melanderi RT25 values were compared to A. mellifera RT25 values since, currently, the EPA generally only requires registrants to conduct residual toxicity assays for A. mellifera when applying for product registration. In doing so, we were able to determine whether Environmental Hazards language reflects the RT25 estimates of M. rotundata and N. melanderi.									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Label language analysis									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We created a composite database of RT25 values from the EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2014) supplemented with calculated values based on the findings of ‘Comparison of RT25 values’. To determine if RT25 values correspond with residual toxicity statements under the Environmental Hazard section of pesticide labels, we used an existing database of residual toxicity statements on pesticides labels developed by Bucy & Melathopoulos (2020) and compared it to RT25 values in our composite RT25 database. The database consisted of 232 labels obtained from products that were used: on 12 Oregon crops around bloom (alfalfa seed, apple, blueberry, carrot seed, cherry, clover seed, cranberry, meadowfoam, pear, pumpkin/squash, radish seed, and watermelon) and California almonds, in Oregon Christmas tree fields during peak times of honey bee activity, to control mosquitos any time of the year, and as garden products available throughout the year to Oregon consumers. We excluded labels from this analysis if: (1) the Environmental Hazards indicated the product was not ‘toxic’ or not ‘highly toxic’ to bees. This would mean that the active ingredient has an LD50 for bees of greater than 11µg/bee, in which case the EPA would not have required that the registrant assess the residual toxicity of that product and/or (2) the product was unlikely to result in exposure to bees (e.g., granular formulations). We only used A. mellifera RT25 values in this analysis since residual toxicity language on pesticide labels is specific to this species (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2012b). Similar to Bucy & Melathopoulos (2020), We interpreted pesticides with short residual toxicity (RT25 <8 h) as corresponding to the statement: “Do not apply…while bees…are actively foraging the treatment area” and those with extended residual toxicity (RT25 >8 h) if accompanied with the statement: “Do not apply…if bees…are foraging the treatment area” found in EPA label language guidance (Fig. 1; United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2012b). We compared the RT25 values to the residual toxicity statements on labels for the same formulation (e.g., emulsifiable concentrate, wettable powder, etc.) of the same active ingredients between the calculated RT25 values and the pesticide.									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The following assumptions were made regarding the interpretation of slight variation from EPA guidance when reviewing labels. “Bees are least active” was interpreted as “Do not apply…while bees…are actively foraging the treatment area” and “Bees may forage” was interpreted as “Do not apply…if bees…are foraging the treatment area”. If no label language associated with RT25 values was present on the label, the data from that label was included as “N/A” in analysis. If no acute toxicity language was present on the label suggesting a LD50 of greater than 11 µg/bee, we excluded the active ingredient from our analysis. If an active ingredient had an LD50 greater than 11 µg/bee, EPA would not require an acute or residual toxicity statement on the product label.									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We determined misalignment between the Environmental Hazards and RT25 estimates based on the extended residual toxicity threshold (see ‘Comparison of RT25 values’). For example, if a label suggested an RT25 value less than 8 h but the database indicated an RT25 estimate that was greater than 8 h, we deemed the label language as not aligning. If a label was not aligning, we further categorized the labels as either having language that was interpreted as a longer RT25 value than we had calculated or as having language that was interpreted as a shorter RT25 value than we had calculated. Many labels had language that corresponded with RT25 values but neither EPA nor the literature examined during the systematic review had information on the active ingredient in the product or a similar formulation to compare the two. These labels were included in the analysis as labels that had “RT25 values missing”.									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Methodology of residual toxicity trials									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Almost three quarters of the studies (70%) analyzed used EPA’s recommended leaf foliage as the treated plant material placed in cages during the residual toxicity trials, with around a quarter of the studies using other materials such as flowers. In all studies, bees stocked in cages with treated plant material were fed sucrose syrup ad libitum. A majority of studies (69%) aligned with the EPA recommendation for a 50% (wt:wt) sucrose to water solution (Fig. 2). The temperature at which bees were incubated during the residual toxicity test varied greatly among the studies. Most studies incubated bees outside the temperature range of 25?35 °C as recommended by the EPA (Fig. 2), tending to incubate at cooler temperatures. The crop used in studies was evenly distributed between the EPA recommendation of alfalfa and other crops. The studies that did not use alfalfa used, in descending order of frequency, cotton, white clover, strawberry, and sunflower. About half of the studies (48%) reported that there were 25 bees placed in the cage for each residual toxicity trial as recommended by the EPA, with remaining studies ranging from 10 to 106 bees per cage. On average, trials using A. mellifera had more bees (56) per cage compared to M. rotundata (24 bees per cage) and N. melanderi (20 bees per cage). The age of the bees used during the residual toxicity trial mostly deviated across studies with almost half of studies (46%) using an older age of bees (>1 day old) than recommended by the EPA.

"RT25 calculations and comparisons									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We calculated RT25 values from 135 of 490 trials in the 50 studies that were reviewed. We were unable to calculate RT25 values for the other 355 trial because published mortality percentage values were either above 25% for all time periods reported or were below 25% for the duration of the assay. In these cases, we indicated the RT25 value as greater than the longest reported period or less than the shortest reported period respectively.									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When comparing RT25 values across different formulations, there were six cases (1.4%) where different formulations with the same rate of the same active ingredient resulted in different RT25 values (Table 2). These cases were									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1Pesticide products used for the calculation of RT25 values for each active ingredient can be found in the Residual Toxicity Data supplementary material.									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"acephate, dimeothate, fipronil, formetanate hydrochloride, naled and trichlorofon. For the same formulation of the same active ingredient with different application rates, 20 active ingredients had different RT25 values with higher application rates having typically longer RT25 values. When comparing across species, there were 21 cases (5%) where different species (A. mellifera, M. rotundata, and N. melanderi) resulted in different calculated RT25 values even though they were exposed to residues of an active ingredient that was applied as the same formulation, at the same application rate, and allowed to weather for the same amount of time. The most variation in RT25 times was seen in active ingredients with the formulation of emulsifiable concentrate with M. rotundata consistently having longer RT25 times (9 cases) compared to A. mellifera (Fig. 3). Finally, there were 11 cases (2.5%) where the same active ingredient at the same formulation applied at the same application rate tested on the same species resulted in contradicting RT25 values.									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Overall, calculated RT25 values from studies matched the extended residual toxicity threshold reported by EPA with a single active ingredient that was not aligned. Notably, this single case, disulfoton emulsifiable concentrate applied at a rate of 1 pound of active ingredient per acre, was close to the extended residual toxicity threshold with a calculated RT25 value of 8.86 h and a published EPA RT25 value of 5.5 h. From our database, we were able to calculate RT25 values for an additional 29 active ingredients that were not present in the EPA’s published database (Fig. 4; United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2014).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Label language comparisons									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Based on the high level of the extended residual toxicity threshold agreement between EPA’s published values (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2014) and the database generated through our systematic review, we supplemented the EPA database with residual toxicity values for pesticides not previously included. Notably, even after supplementing the EPA database, we were still unable to compare the residual toxicity language on the Environmental Hazards section of labels for one third of pesticides due to a lack of data. Of the remaining labels, a third had residual toxicity warnings that corresponded to RT25 values and 27% failed to have any residual toxicity warning despite being toxic to bees. Of the cases where the RT25 values did not correspond to residual toxicity statements, 17% of labels had a statement indicating that the product would remain toxic longer than the RT25 value. The other 10% had a statement indicating the product would remain toxic shorter than the RT25 value (Fig. 5).									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Discussion									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We have developed the most comprehensive database available for RT25 values, which greatly expands the publicly accessible values initially published by the EPA in 2014. Using published studies, we were able to add 29 active ingredients in addition to the EPA’s 70 active ingredient values. We demonstrated that while test methodologies varied among published studies, they are nonetheless consistent in determining whether a pesticide had extended residual toxicity or not, suggesting that variation in methodologies or the environmental conditions under which the tests were conducted did not result in substantively different conclusions on whether or not an applicator could apply the product at bloom in the evening. Despite our efforts to expand on EPA’s existing RT25 database, we found that there remains a paucity of residual toxicity studies. A third of labels in our database did not have corresponding RT25 values in either the RT25 values calculated as part of our study nor the RT25 value estimates published by EPA. We took more variables such as formulation of the active ingredient into account than may have been necessary when calculating RT25 which may have contributed to the lack of comparable RT25 values. For example, future studies may choose to not consider such variables as formulation when calculating RT25 values to maximize the amount of studies usable for calculating each individual RT25 value. Moreover, most studies included in our analysis were published in the 1990s and numerous new active ingredients have since been registered, which illustrates the extent to which researchers have not kept pace with the rate of pesticide product development. Despite these challenges, our systematic review expanded EPA’s RT25 database and was able to draw attention to widespread misalignment between RT25 values and the Pollinator Insect Hazard Statement on pesticide labels that informs pesticide applicators of products with extended residual toxicity.

"There was general agreement on whether an active ingredient had extended residual toxicity (i.e., an RT25 value >8h) between our systematic review and EPA’s database. We found only one deviation across 57 comparable studies of the same active ingredient and application rate. This agreement is remarkable since key aspects of the test methodology were not standardized. Our systematic review RT25 estimates were often within 1–3 h of those published by the EPA. For example, we calculated the RT25 for chlorpyrifos formulated as an emulsifiable concentrate on A. mellifera as 17 h compared to the EPA database estimate of 16 h. However, the approach used in this analysis to compare in terms of the extended residual toxicity threshold instead of point estimates may have reduced the influence of methodological variation. Using the extended residual toxicity threshold, the RT25 value for the pyrethroid insecticide fenpropathrin at 0.4 lbs ai/A for A. mellifera was determined to be greater than 8 h while the EPA reported the value as less than 336 h. Thus, we would deem these two values as the same, because they both support a conclusion of extended residual toxicity, even though the actual estimate of RT25 beyond the 8 h threshold remains unresolved. Nevertheless, the general agreement between studies on extended residual toxicity is remarkable and suggests that RT25 estimates are relatively insensitive to variation in lab technique and weathering conditions.

"Our preliminary finding that lab methodology and field weathering conditions are not important sources of variation for RT25 should be confirmed experimentally. With respect to lab methodology, we think three factors warrant closer examination, namely the temperature at which the assay is performed, the number of bees held in each test cage and the age of bee used in the test. We report considerable variation in the temperature bees are exposed to in test cage, with temperatures tending to be lower on average compared to EPA guidance. Cooler temperatures could decrease bee activity, leading to less overall contact with the pesticide residue and shorter residual toxicity values (Corbet et al., 1993). The number of bees in test cages may also influence RT25 values by concentrating/diluting the pesticide across fewer/greater numbers of bees, resulting in shorter/longer RT25 values. For example, a cage with 500 bees walking over 10g of pesticide contaminated leaf material may ultimately receive a lower dose per bee than if only 10 bees were walking over the same material over the same period of time. We observed that M. rotundata and N. melanderi had, on average, fewer bees per cage compared to A. mellifera which could lead to more contact per bee to the pesticide residues. Most studies deviated from the age of bees recommended by the EPA; however, using less than one day old bees may be distorting, as foraging age bees, which are typically bees that are least three weeks old, are the bees likely to contact weathered residues in the field. Notably, a factor that was largely omitted from most studies was a description of the weathering conditions, such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, and cloud cover. Potentially, weathering conditions may have a larger impact on RT25 estimates than variation in laboratory methodology.									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We observed trends in RT25 values among different rates and formulations of active ingredients. Typically, the higher the application rate of a pesticides, the longer the calculated RT 25 values. For example, the calculated RT25 value for the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos emulsifiable concentrate with A. mellifera was 17 h at the rate of 0.25 lb ai/A and 99 h RT25 time at 0.5 lb ai/A. This suggests that RT25 may be different for different application rates, which draws into question the premise of the Pollinating Insect Hazard Statement, where a single residual toxicity statement is meant to cover multiple different use patterns of a pesticide, such as different rates. Notably, new guidance issued by EPA (2017) moves away from relying on the Pollinating Insect Hazard Statement to convey residual toxicity estimates, relying more on specific use directions, where rate and crop are specified. Our results suggest this shift will provide applicators with more guidance on the specific residual times they might experience in the field.									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The species of bee used to estimate RT25 exhibited notable patterns that should be further investigated. In general, we observed that for the same active ingredient applied at the same rate and formulation M. rotundata had longer RT25 times compared to A. mellifera, and that N. melanderi had both shorter and longer RT25 times compared to A. mellifera. Emulsifiable concentrates were associated with the largest difference in RT25 estimates among species, with M. rotundata consistently having longer RT25 values than A. mellifera for these formulations. It is unclear what is the source of these patterns. One hypothesis is that M. rotundata may be more susceptible to pesticides as this species lacks the ability to detoxify certain synthetic insecticides that are normally metabolized by other bee species (Hayward et al., 2019). Certainly, several studies have indicated differential toxicity of pesticides to different bee taxa (Johansen et al., 1983a; Johansen et al., 1983b; Mayer, Kovacs & Lunden, 1998; Devillers & Pham-Delegue, 2002). Another possible explanation for the difference between bee species could be their size difference. M. rotundata has the smallest average size of the three bees we analyzed and, therefore, would have the highest ratio of surface area to body volume. The higher surface area to body volume ratio results in a higher rate in the accumulation of lethal dosages over time (Johansen et al., 1983a; Johansen et al., 1983b; Wisk et al., 2014) potentially resulting in longer RT25 times for smaller bees, for a given toxicity of a pesticide. Little research has been done into the effects of differing formulations on the residual toxicity across bee species. A species comparative study would be useful to determine what variables (e.g., differences in behavior, different physiology, etc.) contribute to the differing residual toxicity values. Currently, the EPA publicly reports (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2014) RT25 times primarily for A. mellifera, with limited data available on other species of pollinating bees. Researchers also primarily use A. mellifera when conducting pesticide risk assessments which lead to large knowledge gaps for other pollinating bees impacted by pesticides (Tosi et al., 2022). Differences in species residual toxicity times have been noticed in the past (Johansen et al., 1983a; Johansen et al., 1983b; Mayer, Lunden & Jasso, 1997) and variation in pesticide sensitivity among bee species has been shown which could suggest variation in residual toxicity times (Arena & Sgolastra, 2014). However, there have been no in-depth studies designed to comparatively characterize RT25 estimates for different species, let alone resolve the mechanisms by which bees may respond to the dissipation of residues differently. Our results suggest that honey bee residual toxicity assay results may not be generalizable to other bee species as has been done in the past. Variation in RT25 estimates for different bee species would be important information for pesticide applicators, particularly if they are using residual times for bee species with the shortest RT25 values.									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The finding from our study that is of greatest concern to pesticide applicators was widespread misalignment between RT25 values and statements of residual toxicity in the Pollinating Insect Hazard Statement. Of the pesticide labels we were able to compare to calculated RT25 values, almost a third were inaccurate in the wording of their Pollinating Insect Hazard Statement. For example, the formulated end-use product Perm-Up 3.2 EC (USEPA registration number 70506-9) containing the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin indicates the product should not be applied while bees are “actively visiting” suggesting a less than 8-hour residual toxicity time. However, the residual toxicity studies for permethrin consistently indicated RT25 values greater than 8 h even at the lowest application rate calculated, 0.05 lb ai/A. Although this finding is concerning, some of these discrepancies may arise from our assumption that all pesticides with the same active ingredient and applied at the same rate have similar RT25 values. Potentially, pesticide products may have different residual times owing to features independent of the active ingredient, such as inert ingredients. Our assumption that RT25 can be generalized across products containing the same active ingredient is supported by our findings that RT25 estimates were largely consistent for active ingredients across studies and relative to estimates published by EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2014). Nevertheless, we suggest caution in interpreting our results since the number of different products used to estimate RT25 values for each active ingredient tended to be dwarfed by the total number of registered products containing those ingredients on the market. Regardless, our study indicates that either there is high variability in residual toxicity between pesticides containing the same active ingredients, which calls into the question efforts like the EPA’s to publish RT25 values based on active ingredients, or the Pollinating Insect Hazard Statement on existing pesticide labels aligns poorly with RT25 values. Our data currently suggests the latter problem predominates, resulting in pesticide applicators lacking a reliable piece of information to mitigate exposure to bees during bloom.									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One thing is clear from our study: there remain large gaps in our database of RT25 estimates. Although this database is the most comprehensive to date, and expands on published values by the EPA, the lack of publicly accessible RT25 estimates is something we hope researchers will make a concerted effort to address. We also encourage the EPA to review its existing data from registrants, which is unavailable to researchers, pesticide applicators and the public, and fill gaps in its public-facing database. Alternatively, the EPA could develop a mechanism to release registrant-collected residual toxicity data to the public to enable researchers to develop such a database independently. While estimating residual toxicity has been a part of the pesticide risk assessment process for decades, its relevance continues with new guidance around label language that foregrounds RT25 values beyond the Environmental Hazard section to the crop-specific directions for use on the label (United States Protection Agency, 2017). The need to create a basis for evaluation of these changes is not only important for pesticide applicators who are seeking instruction to protect bees from exposure, but for the sustainable management of domesticated managed bee stocks and wild bee communities.									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Conclusions									",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Through our efforts, we were successfully able to create a compendium of RT25 values that could be used to determine if pesticide label language aligns with calculated active ingredient RT25 values. There was noticeable variation in species and application rate which could call into question whether a single Pollinating Insects Hazards Statement is sufficient to fully communicate the hazards of a pesticide product. Further comparison of the calculated values to published EPA values revealed that lab methodology does not seem to affect RT25 values as seen from comparison of study values to the EPA, though field conditions during the weathering of the pesticide may need to be explored further. Comparing a combined database of published EPA values and our calculated RT25 values to label language showed significant misalignment in Pollinating Insect Hazard Statements. The variation in residual toxicity remains an emerging field of research that must be addressed to ensure the applications of pesticides is occurring in a safe manner to minimize the risk towards pollinating bees.

"Abstract
Pesticides are being discharged into the environment at an increasing rate, particularly into water resources, as agricultural productivity increases. These contaminants need to break down and mineralize as soon as possible since they are extremely dangerous to aquatic life and human health. The advanced oxidation method based on sulfate radicals (SR-AOP) has gained popularity recently for treating organic pollutants like pesticides because of its great efficacy and low environmental impact. This article goes into detail about the many ways for activating persulfate (PS) and peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for pesticides degradation, such as UV light, carbon-based materials, TMs, ultrasonic, electrochemical, heat, microwave, photoelectrons, alkali, and hybrid activation. The mechanisms of pesticide the degradation by SR-AOP, as well as the detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS), are also addressed. The effect of operational parameters such as PS/PMS concentration, catalyst dose, pH, pesticide starting concentration, and organic and inorganic matter on pesticide degradation by SR-AOP is also discussed. The toxicity of the degraded intermediates, as well as enhancing pesticide total mineralization under SR-AOP, was also investigated. Finally, prospects for future research and application of SR-AOP in pesticides removal from water are highlighted.

Introduction
The extensive use of chemical pesticides to control pests resulted in a significant increase in agricultural crop productivity, but it also polluted the various elements of the environment with pesticide residues, particularly water, on a global scale. Pesticides, for example, have contaminated a variety of water sources especially surface water as a result of their widespread use in agriculture, and it is a major source of concern on a local, regional, national, and global scale (Palins et al. 1997; Huber et al. 2000; Tsuda et al. 2009; Tanabe and Kawata 2009; Phong et al. 2012; Herrero-Hernandez et al. 2013; Derbalah and Ismael 2013; Narushima et al. 2014; Kaonga et al. 2015; Chidya et al. 2018; Derbalah et al. 2013, 2014, 2016, 2019). Over 4 million tons per year pesticides are used in the world for agricultural applications, which can threaten seriously human health and the environmental resources (Weber 2018). These compounds mostly have high stability and resistance in the environment, so are accumulated in aquatic organisms when discharge into water. Pesticides that subsequently appear in water ecosystems impact biological communities and public health that come into direct or indirect contact (Wee and Aris 2017). Likewise, humans are becoming gradually more vulnerable to various acute and chronic diseases, which differ by geography and food inclinations of those who are exposed (Noyes et al. 2009). Because of the harmful and toxic side effects of pesticides and major public concern worldwide, the quality of surface and ground waters has deteriorated (Rodrigo et al. 2010; Zhou et al. 2017a, b). Moreover, water scarcity is an important issue that is aggravated through the increasingly prolonged droughts related to climate change (Amor et al. 2019a, b). Thus, water protection is an emerging concern that should be tackled by science and industry and this path goes through suitable wastewater treatment and management technologies.

Because of their promising prospects for pesticide degradation and mineralization in water, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have piqued many researchers interests in recent years (Nienow et al. 2008; Senthilnathan and Philip 2010; Antonaraki et al. 2010; Nitoi et al. 2013; Derbalah and Ismael 2013; Ismael et al. 2015; Derbalah et al. 2013, 2014, 2016, 2019). In the AOPs system, oxidants are activated in various ways to produce hydroxyl radicals (•OH) with a strong oxidizing capacity, which can convert persistent pesticides to minimally or non-toxic small molecules (Nienow et al. 2008; Senthilnathan and Philip 2010; Antonaraki et al. 2010; Nitoi et al. 2013; Derbalah and Ismael 2013; Ismael et al. 2015; Derbalah et al. 2013, 2014, 2016, 2019). However, organic pollutants like pesticides are degraded by •OH-based AOPs using non-selective multistep routes, and this typically needs an acidic environment (Derbalah et al. 2014). Furthermore, in complicated matrices with rich dissolved organic materials (DOMs) and carbonate/bicarbonate anions, all of which are important •OH scavengers, he effectiveness of •OH-based AOPs is significantly reduced (Sakkas et al. 2002; Derbalah et al. 2004).

Due to the aforementioned drawbacks, the sulfate-based advanced oxidation process (SR-AOP) was introduced to replace the •OH-based AOP (Yang et al. 2019). Sulfate radicals (SO4• ?) have a higher oxidation potential (2.5–3.1 V) than •OH (1.8–2.7 V) (Mei et al. 2019). Furthermore, the half-life of SO4• ? (30–40 s) is much longer than that of •OH (20 ns), showing that SO4• ? can effectively react with organic pollutants and improve mass transfer effectiveness (Delavaran Shiraz et al. 2018). Furthermore, •OH -based AOPs typically operates in acidic conditions, whereas SR-AOP broaden their applications to include neutral or even basic conditions (Yu et al. 2020). At a wider operating pH range, SR-AOPs outperform standard hydroxyl radical-based AOPs (Tsitonaki et al. 2010). Furthermore, persulfate (PS) and peroxymonosulfate (PMS) are easily transported in the solid phase as sulfate radical oxidants, while hydrogen peroxide's hydroxyl radical oxidant is in the liquid phase. As a result, SR-AOPs are predicted to display enhanced catalytic efficiency in pesticide degradation and mineralization. As a result, SR-AOP are becoming increasingly popular for environmental cleanup (Wang et al. 2021).

In SR-AOP, PMS (HSO5?) and PS (S2O82?) are frequently employed oxidants. They are viewed as potential candidates in the AOPs system because they are more stable, simpler to transport, and store than H2O2. It is challenging to directly oxidize organic contaminants with PMS and PS such as pesticides and must be activated via proper methods to generate reactive species such as SO4• ? and •OH. Different techniques were already employed to activate PS/PMS and produce reactive species, including ultraviolet (UV) light, ultrasound (US), electrochemical oxidation (EO), heat, alkali, TMs, photogenerated electrons, radiation, and carbon-based materials (Aimer et al. 2019; Miao et al. 2020; Hong et al. 2021; He et al. 2021; Yang et al. 2021; Shen et al. 2022). Numerous laboratory and field studies have shown that most of these techniques efficiently activate PS/PMS and quickly degrade and mineralize contaminants like pesticides (Aimer et al. 2019; Miao et al. 2020; Hong et al. 2021; He et al. 2021; Yang et al. 2021; Shen et al. 2022).

Spite of SR-AOP has been used in numerous review studies to remove other organic pollutants from water, including pesticides, but there has not been a collective investigation focused only on pesticides with their different classes as pollutants up to this point. In addition, there are no collective review studies that analyze and summarize the variation in pesticides toxicity, specifically during degradation process by SR-AOP, and tried to find strategies for enhancing the rate of their detoxification and mineralization. Moreover, difficulties and future opportunities for useful SR-AOP applications for removing pesticides from water have not been proposed before. As a result, we outline and analyze numerous recent advancements in PS/PMS activation methods, ROS identification, and degradation mechanisms using SR-AOP in this study. The review also focuses at how operational conditions affect the effectiveness of SR-AOP for pesticides removal from water. In addition, the improvement of detoxification and mineralization of pesticides in treated water as well as the toxicity assessment of pesticide by-products during the degradation process by SR-AOP were also summarized. Finally, difficulties and opportunities for further research and useful SR-AOP applications for removing pesticides from water have been proposed.

Oxidant agents for SR-AOP
An oxidizing agent, such as PS (S2O8 –2) or PMS (HSO5–), the properties of which are described in Table 1, is activated to produce sulfate radicals. The most prevalent type of PMS is a triple potassium salt, 2KHSO5. KHSO4.K2SO4, called Oxone. It is non-toxic, readily dissolved in water, and stable over a broad pH range. It should be noted that •OH, and sulfur pentoxide radicals (SO5• ?), beside SO4• ? are also present when PMS activated (Ghanbari and Moradi 2017; Manos et al. 2020), as shown in Equs. (1)–(3).

The PS, unlike the PMS, has a symmetrical structure, increasing its stability and increasing the activation energy (Xiao et al. 2020; Giannakis et al. 2021). PS crystalline salts such as sodium persulfate (Na2S2O8) or potassium persulfate are the most common and stable form. The most used salt for water decontamination is Na2S2O8, which is more soluble in water than PMS (Manos et al. 2020). It is worth noting that, in addition to the formation of SO4•?, •OH can also develop throughout the PS activation process (Xiao et al. 2020). Aside from the symmetry of the molecules, the redox potential is another distinction between the PMS and the PS. PS has a greater capacity for oxidation than PMS, as shown in Table 1. Nonetheless, both agents have been investigated due to their benefits, such as high-water solubility, environmental friendliness, and relation between costs and effectiveness (Xiao et al. 2020). Noteworthy is the fact that, in addition to SO4•?, peroxydisulfate radicals (S2O8??) can be formed during the PS activation process (Giannakis et al. 2021), as shown in Eqs. (4)–(5). It must be emphasized that these agents should be activated to generate sulfate radicals to realize their full potential.

PS/PMS Activation Methods for Degrading Pesticides
PS/PMS can be activated for pesticides degradation using metal-free methods as presented in Table 2, metal-based catalyst methods as presented in Table 3, as well as using carbon-based materials, alkali, electrochemical, and hybrid methods as presented in Table 4. All the different activation methods of PS/PMS for pesticide removal in water are also illustrated in Fig. 1.

Catalyst-Free Activation
UV Activation
PS/PMS are activated by UV illumination to produce SO4• ? and •OH radicals (He et al. 2021). Since PS is a symmetrical oxidant, two SO4• ? are produced as shown in Eq. (6). The unsymmetrical oxidation of PMS, however, results in the generation of one •OH and one SO4• ? as Eq. (7). According to Eq. (8), the partial SO4• ? can spontaneously change to •OH in the aqueous solution. More conversion is possible at alkaline pH values for this reaction, which is strongly influenced by pH (Equ. (9)). (Yang et al. 2019).

Because of its environmental friendliness, PS/PMS activation by UV irradiation is regarded as a promising approach. Also, the degradation of pesticides by this activation method can occur through species-assisted indirect reactive photolysis in the UV/PS system and direct UV photolysis (Khan et al. 2016, 2017, 2021; Wang et al. 2020a, b, c; He et al. 2021; Liu et al. 2022). Moreover, in comparison to UV photolysis and PMS or PS oxidation alone, the UV/PS and UV/PMS systems showed a higher degradation efficiency of pesticides such as atrazine, imidacloprid and lindane (Khan et al. 2014, 2017, 2021; Wang et al. 2020a, b, c; He et al. 2021).

Ultrasonic Activation
The formation of bubbles in the liquid is enhanced when the solution is exposed to ultrasonic waves of a specific frequency and intensity, demonstrating the formation, growth, and collapse of bubbles. Local temperature and pressure rise locally in the vicinity of the collapsing cavitation bubbles (Lebik-Elhadi et al. 2020). PS/PMS may be activated in these circumstances, resulting in the production of reactive species like SO4• ? and •OH. In addition, ultrasound assisted activation enhances the mass transfer reaction in solution in addition to inducing the production of reactive species (Lebik-Elhadi et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2021). Pollutants degradation efficiency including pesticides enhanced as ultrasonic power intensity grew, but high power caused larger bubbles to form, which decreased energy efficiency (Chen and Huang 2019; Lebik-Elhadi et al. 2020). For example, Lebik-Elhadi et al. (2020) reported that thiamethoxam can be effectively degraded by the ultrasound activated persulfate process at environmentally relevant concentrations and degradation efficacy increased as ultrasonic power intensity increased.

Microwave Activation
Since UV rays cannot easily pass-through water and are not readily transported through wastewater, it was of interest that PS and PMS be activated by different forms of radiation (Qi et al. 2014). Microwave radiation (MW) is a cost-effective method for pesticide removal in water by activating PS, and dramatically enhance the degradation and mineralization of pesticides like imidacloprid (Genc and Durna 2018). Microwaves irradiations convert energy into heat and speed up the activation reactions, in contrast to conventional heating methods that rely on passive heat transfer to the material’s depth (Qi et al. 2014; Genc and Durna 2018; Genç et al. 2020).

Heat Activation
Energy (heat) can be applied to activate PS and PMS (Yang et al. 2021) and produce sulfate radicals via broken the peroxide bond (Equs. (10) and (11)). (Aimer et al. 2019; Lu et al. 2022). Heat-activated PS/PMS process, has been successfully used to accelerate the degradation of several pesticides, including dimethoate and atrazine (Tan et al. 2012; Aimer et al. 2019; Yang et al. 2021; Lu et al. 2022). Many organic compounds, including organochlorine herbicides (Vicente et al. 2011; Tan et al. 2012; Ji et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2016), fungicides (Yang et al. 2017), and organophosphorus pesticides, have been studied using heat-activated persulfate degradation (Rasoulifard et al. 2015; Zhou et al. 2017a, b; Aimer et al. 2019). Furthermore, while higher temperatures and PS/PMS dosage can improve pesticide degradation efficiency, increasing pesticide concentrations can decrease it (Lu et al. 2022). Because it consumes so much energy, the PS/PMS thermally activation method has few practical applications. However, the high energy consumption in this method can be overcome by using excess heat from the manufacturing environment to activate PS/PMS to remove organic pollutants (Wang et al. 2021).

(10)
(11)
Visible Light Activation
Generally (Hori et al. 2005), PS/PMS cannot be directly activated by visible light (wavelength?>?400 nm). However, in limited cases, PS/PMS activation can be caused by visible light to degrade some pesticides, such as atrazine, but with very poor efficacy. For instance, Wei et al. (2022) found that only 5% of atrazine was eliminated by the Vis/PMS system.

Metal-Based Catalyst Activation
Transition Metals Activation
Due to their high reactivity and low-energy consumption, activation of PS/PMS by TMs have generated growing interest for the removal of pesticides (Hayat et al. 2022; Shen et al. 2022). TMs activation for PS/PMS can be divided into homogeneous and heterogeneous categories depending on the type of catalysts used. By homogeneously activating PS/PMS with TM ions (Co2+, Ce3+, Ag+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Ni2+, Ru3+, Mn2+, etc.) or heterogeneously activating PS/PMS with metal oxides (manganese and cobalt oxides, as well as zinc ferrite, or others), SO4• ? can be produced efficiently (Vicente et al. 2011; Bu et al. 2016; Chi et al. 2019; Deng et al. 2019).

Homogeneous Activators
Certain TM ions as mentioned before can be utilized in homogeneous phase to activate PS/ PMS for the production of active species capable of degrading organic contaminants such as pesticides (Vicente et al. 2011; Bu et al. 2016; Chi et al. 2019; Deng et al. 2019). Significant mass transfer and fully exposed PS/PMS activation of metal atoms are both displayed by homogeneous catalysts. Fe2+ and Co2+ are two of the TM ions that are predicted to have the highest activation effectiveness for PS and PMS, respectively (Bu et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2019b; Chen et al. 2019b). A proper molar ratio of TM ions to PS/PMS is required in the homogeneous catalyst activation process to maximize the degradation of organic contaminants like pesticides (Vicente et al. 2011; Bu et al. 2016).

Both the Fe2+/PS and Fe2+/PMS systems typically have a two-stage reaction process for the degradation of pesticides, with the first stage being fast and the second stage being slow. The initial stage proceeds quickly due to the abundance of reactants and the fast production of radicals, but as the reaction progresses, the formation of radicals slows down as a result of the consumption of Fe2+ (Bu et al. 2016). Consequently, the initial rate of pesticide degradation in the homogeneous catalyst activation system was higher, and the subsequent rate was flat (Bu et al. 2016). To improve the catalytic activity of TM ions, adding chelating or reducing agents is a fantastic alternative. Moreover, sequential Fe2+ addition improves degradation performance of pesticides such as diuron while one-time Fe2+ spiking results in low degradation rate due to a high rate of radical quenching (Vicente et al. 2011).

Heterogeneous Activators
Although the homogeneous system is highly effective at degrading different pesticides by PS/PMS activation (Vicente et al. 2011; Bu et al. 2016), there are a number of drawbacks that severely restrict its practical applications as cited by Wang et al. (2021). First, the majority of metal ions are harmful to ecosystems; Co2+, for instance, is hazardous and can contribute to more environmental damage. Second, TM ions are hard to reprocess and need the constant addition of new homogeneous catalysts. Third, metal ions in excess react with generated reactive species and cause considerable side reactions.

Recent years have seen a rise in interest in the study of heterogeneous catalysts as a means of overcoming these homogeneous system limitations. The heterogeneous catalysts not only have excellent PS/PMS catalytic activity for the removal of organic contaminants, including pesticides but also possess stability and easy-recycling properties (Li et al. 2018; Wu et al. 2018; Dong et al. 2019; Lin et al. 2019; Liu et al. 2019a, b, c; Xu et al. 2019; Sheikhi et al. 2021). For example, nZVI/GP composite was shown to be able to effectively activate PS to remove 92.1% of atrazine within 21 min, as opposed to 66.1%in the nZVI/PS system and 36.7% in the GP/PS system after 60 min. Furthermore, the removal efficiency was still 84.7% in the third cycles, demonstrating higher stability and cyclability (Wu et al. 2018).

Due to their high reactivity, AOPs that generate both •OH and SO4•? through PMS activation by heterogeneous catalysts have received a lot of attention in the quest to degrade resistant organic compounds. In a previous study, fabricated heterogeneous catalyst such as nAgFeO2 markedly activate PMS activation and significantly improved imidacloprid removal in water (Kan et al. 2020). Also, Fe3O4? sepiolite composite was an effective and recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for the activation of PS and removal of atrazine water (Xu et al. 2019). Furthermore, activation of PMS using N-doped TiO2 (NT) catalyst under visible light increases the production of reactive radicals and speeds up the degradation of pesticides (Abdelhaleem and Chu 2018).

The use of zero-valent iron (ZVI) as a common heterogeneous catalyst to activate PMS for pesticide removal from water has been extensively researched (Hayat et al. 2021). In the PS or PMS/ZVI system, Fe0 was first converted to Fe2+ via H+ and dissolved oxygen degradation, and thereafter Fe2+ activated PS or PMS to produce free radicals (Eqs. (12)–(14)). As a result, the degradation rate of pesticides such as methomyl in the Fe0/PMS system was faster for several minutes before becoming flat (Hayat et al. 2021). Because of its larger surface area, nanoscale ZVI was thought to react more quickly than granular ZVI (Li et al. 2014). The nanoscale ZVI/PS system has been investigated for preventing contamination of the environment and has demonstrated superior pesticide degradation performance (Hayat et al. 2019). However, Graça et al. (2018) discovered that microscale ZVI outperformed nanoscale ZVI in the degradation of the amicarbazone via PS activation. When the nanoscale ZVI was mixed with PS, a large amount of Fe2+ was released, whereas the microscale ZVI gradually released Fe2+. However, extra Fe2+ could scavenge reactive species generated. Moreover, because of the initial amount of Fe2+ release, PS was overconsumed and therefore unable to support the succeeding reaction. Furthermore, microscale ZVI was a great substitute in terms of practical applicability (Graca et al. 2018).

Because it has the ability to invade cell membranes, nanoscale ZVI poses a potential threat to organisms (Xue et al. 2018). However, Li et al. (2020b) reported that the release of Fe2+ from Fe0 remained the rate-limiting step because the formation of Fe(IV) was primarily dependent on the release of Fe2+ and the ferryl ion (Fe(IV)) as reactive species also involved in atrazine degradation by PMS activated using ZVI (Equs. (15)–(17). (Li et al. 2020b). In-depth research was also done by Wang et al. (2020c) on the proportional contribution of Fe(IV) at various Fe0 and PMS initial concentrations. The findings prove that although the impact of Fe(IV) changed less noticeably as Fe0 concentration varied, it increased as PMS level did. When PMS levels rose, excess PMS preferred to consume SO4• ? rather than Fe(IV), which increased the contribution of Fe(IV) to pollutant removal (Wang et al. 2020f).

Photo-Electrons Activation
PS/PMS can be activated by capturing photoelectrons generated by photocatalytic systems when exposed to visible light, and then generating active species to oxidize different pollutants such as pesticides (Shen et al. 2020b, 2022). For example, Shen et al. (2020b) fount that the degrading efficacy of atrazine in the Bi2MoO6/PMS/vis system (99%), was much greater than the Bi2MoO6/PMS (30%) and Bi2MoO6/vis (22%) systems (Shen et al. 2020b). As a result, a practical technique for reducing organic pollutants is to combine the photocatalytic process with PS/PMS activation.

Despite the use of photocatalysts such as bismuth molybdate (Bi2MoO6) to activate PMS under visible light for pesticides removal in aquatic system (Shen et al. 2020a, b), the catalyst modification like metal ion doping such as Fe3+/Bi2MoO6/PMS/vis system demonstrated strong photocatalytic synergy for pesticides degradation (Shen et al. 2022) but it may be expensive and require complicated synthesis steps. However, the removal effectiveness was remained controlled by mixing of photogenerated hole-electron pairs in the light/Bi2MoO6/PMS system.

Electrochemical Activation
Due to its quick and effective oxidation of persistent pollutants such as pesticides, EO is becoming more popular (Sopaj et al. 2015; Aimer et al. 2019; Cai et al. 2021). Despite the high energy required of EO of PS/PMS for pesticide degradation, the external addition of PS and PMS can create extra active species such the sulfate radical for the degradation of organic contaminants, including pesticides (Wac?awek et al. 2016; Bu et al. 2018; Song et al. 2018; Aimer et al. 2019; Cai et al. 2021; Wang et al. 2021). Electrochemical activation of PS enhanced both the catalytic reaction rate and catalytic impact via electrical ion exchange. Electrochemistry enables the persulfate to transfer energy, breaking the peroxide bond and forming two SO4• ? molecules (Equs. 18 and 19). (Song et al. 2018).

(18)
(19)
Recently, an electrochemical method was used to activate PS and PMS for efficient removal of atrazine, 2,4-D, and dimethoate (Wac?awek et al. 2016; Bu et al. 2018; Aimer et al. 2019; Cai et al. 2021). In fact, higher current density let to the production of further active radicals, which improved atrazine degradation efficiency (Bu et al. 2018; Aimer et al. 2019). Although electrochemical activation method of PS/PMS may remove contaminants effectively, the high energy consumption may prevent large-scale practical applications (Wang et al. 2021).

Alkali Activation
Bases (such as Ca (OH)2, NaOH, and KOH) can be used to activate PS/ PMS and generate ROS for the removal of contaminants like pesticides (Peng et al. 2015; Santos et al. 2018). In recent years, the activation of PS by a base (NaOH), as described in Eq. (20) (Furman et al. 2010), has been proposed. The alkali-activated PS/PMS technology is better suited to removing pesticides from water (Peng et al. 2015; Santos et al. 2018). Santos et al. (2018), for example, investigated the removal of lindane by alkali-activated PS in ground water and found that about 90% of the HCH was degraded after 25 days (Santos et al. 2018).

(20)
Carbon-Based Materials Activation
One of the disadvantages of using TMs in activation of PS/PMS is the leaching of metal ions, although many optimization strategies for activators based on TMs have been researched. Due to their affordability and biocompatibility, metal-free catalysts for the removal of organic pollutants, carbon-based compounds such as nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (rGO) (Wu et al. 2020; Tan et al. 2022), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), activated carbon (AC), biochar, and nitrogen-doped carbon fiber aerogel, have received a lot of interest.

In terms of ROS, there are various methods that carbon-based compounds might activate PMS/PS, include radical generation (Eqs. (21) and (22), the creation of charge transfer complexes, singlet oxygen (1O2) production, direct catalysis via a nonradical pathway, or a mix of radical and nonradical pathways (Xiao et al. 2018; Pedrosa et al. 2019; Tan et al. 2022). Furthermore, because these substances often have a high capacity for adsorption, which has the benefit of removing some pollutants on their own (Duan et al. 2018; Tan et al. 2022).

(21)
(22)
Carbon-based materials have been widely used in the removal of a variety of pollutants, including pesticides (Chen et al. 2019a; Sun et al. 2020b; Xing et al. 2020; Hong et al. 2021; Liang et al. 2021; Tan et al. 2022).

By activating PS/PMS, carbon-based materials demonstrated high pesticide degradation efficiency. As an example, Hong et al. (2021) found that biochar-based composites (FeS@biochar/PMS) show a strong potential in activating PMS and was highly effective for eliminating 2,4-D in water. Furthermore, Liang et al. (2021) discovered that the biochar-based composites (Co3O4 @biochar/PMS) system effectively removed 2,4-D and outlines innovative approaches for using carbon-based materials to purify water, successfully treating pesticide-contaminated wastewater, and utilizing agricultural waste as a resource. Tan et al. (2022) also reported that bifunctional oxygen-doped graphitic carbon nitride (OCN) removed approximately 94.5 percent of imidacloprid.

Fabricated carbon-based materials demonstrated high pesticide degradation effectiveness (Dangwang-Dikdim et al. 2019; Hong et al. 2021; Liang et al. 2021; Tan et al. 2022) but low reusability. Furthermore, doped heteroatoms, oxygen-containing functional groups, and defects in carbon-based catalysts can function as PS/PMS activation sites. The low reusability carbon-based catalysts may be due to the loss of heteroatoms, functional groups, and problems during degradation. To accomplish these limitations, Cheng et al. (2019) used long-term UV irradiation to repair deficiencies on CNT surfaces, which allowed them to recover most of the active sites on CNTs after multiple recycles (Cheng et al. 2019). Other effective carbon material renewable techniques must be designed for use in practical situations.

Hybrid Activation
Because each of the aforementioned activation methods has pros and limitations, combining two or more of them allows pesticide removal efficiency to be improved. Table 4 provides examples of pesticide removal using hybrid activation of PS/PMS such as combining a metallic catalyst (either homogeneous or heterogeneous) with radiation, such as UV and US, (Abdelhaleem and Chu 2019; Rezaie et al. 2019; Zheng et al. 2022). For example, Zheng et al. (2022), found that the prepared Co-doped Fe3O4 magnetic particles encapsulated by zirconium-based metal–organic frameworks (Co-Fe3O4@UiO-66) effectively activate PMS and demonstrated efficient catalytic performance, removing more than 90.0% of fenitrothion. Because this research can not only eliminate organophosphorus via catalytic oxidation but also adsorbing degraded phosphorus, it represents a viable and practical technique for building other adaptable eco-friendly nanomaterial composites. Furthermore, TMs catalysts can be combined with electrochemical or photoelectron methods for PS activation to improve the degradation efficacy of pesticides like 2,4-D and atrazine (Li et al. 2019a, b, c, d, e; Mehralipour and Kermani 2021).

Pros and Cons of Various Activation Techniques for Wastewater Treatment
The reaction rate is frequently incredibly low when PS/PMS reacts with pesticides by themselves. Consequently, PS/PMS must be activated to treat organic pollutants in wastewater, such as pesticides. As shown in Table 2, 3 and 4, various activation techniques can be combined to speed up the activation of PS/PMS and the removal of contaminants like pesticides in practical applications. Each activation technique has advantages and disadvantages of its own (Table 5). Table 5 lists the benefits, drawbacks, and costs of various PS/PMS activation techniques for the removal of organic contaminants, including pesticides. All techniques can, in theory, be chosen based on real wastewater treatment conditions. However, the real varieties of wastewaters are numerous, variable, and complex, making it difficult to compare to a laboratory or small operation. The effects of inorganic salts and organic matter in water must be taken into account, as well as operational issues including the pH range, production of poisonous and dangerous metabolites, rise in expenses of equipment operation, catalyst deactivation, and other issues. As a result, not every activation method is suitable for industrial expansion production. Microwave activation, for example, while having good degrading outcomes, is toxic to the human body and must be handled with caution, and the equipment needs are substantially higher. They will raise many costs if they are used in industrial production, so there are few practical applications (Wang and Wang 2022). For dangerous and hazardous compounds that may be produced in the reaction system as a result of incomplete reactions, UV or electrochemistry activation, organic contaminants may be oxidized into more hazardous intermediate compounds. Anode slime is also produced during electrochemistry activation, whereas secondary pollution c",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Abstract
As has long been the case for conventional agriculture, organic agriculture is increasingly characterized by the consolidation of production into the hands of larger operations. Using historical pesticide applications records from the California Pesticide Use Report (PUR), this study identified individual organic fields, to document the occurrence of cropland consolidation, and assess the correlation between cropland consolidation and pesticide use. Our results show that pesticide use is correlated with the consolidation of organic cropland. Farms with more organic acreage applied sulfur and fixed copper pesticides more frequently after controlled for the crop type and field size. As the result, larger farms had greater environmental impacts on surface water and smaller impacts on soil and air because sulfur and fixed copper are more toxic to fish and algae, and less toxic to earthworms and have lower Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions than other pesticides used in organic fields.

1. Introduction
Organic agriculture is often proposed as an essential part of sustainable food systems (Muller et al., 2017). Existing studies have evaluated the environmental performance of organic agriculture as a system and compared it with conventional agriculture from many aspects (Gomiero et al., 2011; Hartmann et al., 2015; Pimentel et al., 2005; Tuomisto et al., 2012; Seufert and Ramankutty, 2017).

Consumers often associate organic agriculture with small farms and diverse crop production (Adams and Salois, 2010), which might not be true anymore for organic agriculture in California because the consolidation process had been clearly documented for the organic food processing sector (Howard, 2009) and the U.S. agriculture in general (MacDonald et al., 2018).

Pesticide pressures and pesticide use are found to be correlated with farm size and field size (Wu et al., 2018; Rosenheim et al., 2022). If large organic farms apply pesticides differently from small ones, the consolidation into larger operations could undermine the perception of organic agriculture as environmentally friendly and hinder the development of organic agriculture.

Most pesticide products used in organic agriculture are generally less toxic than their conventional counterparts, but their reduced efficacy could drive higher application rates, which makes the overall environmental impact of organic agriculture less obvious. Meanwhile, certain pesticides used in organic agriculture have been found to be more toxic than conventional pesticides targeting the same pest (Biondi et al., 2012; Bahlai et al., 2010). Pesticide use in organic agriculture required special focus because study has shown that pesticide use is mainly driven by the crop value (Rosenheim et al., 2020).

Few studies have investigated the pesticide use patterns for organic fields and their environmental impacts. (Larsen et al., 2021) showed that organic fields are 30% more likely to not be sprayed by any pesticide compared to conventional fields. But, their study limited to productions only in the Kern county, where carrots accounted for 25% of the organic acreage. Therefore, more evidence is needed to: (1) quantitatively describe pesticide use in organic agriculture; (2) assess its environmental impacts for ecosystems on a large scale across numerous crops over a long time period; (3) and identify their relation with changes in farm size.

This study focus on how large organic farms apply pesticides differently, which also contributes to the large body of literature on farm size issues that started as least from (Sen, 1962). Researchers have found that farming practices involving labor, output price, and technology adoption vary significantly across farms with different sizes (Feder, 1985; Barrett, 1996; Fan and Chan-Kang, 2005; Rada and Fuglie, 2019). While previous studies emphasized on the economic outcomes such as productivity and poverty alleviation, our analysis focuses on the environmental impacts that resulted from changes in pesticide use, which helps us to understand more about the future of organic agriculture as the sector expanded.

In this study, we use California's Pesticide Use Report (PUR) database to identify individual organic fields, characterize pesticide use and cropland consolidation patterns, and assess the environmental impacts of pesticide use in California organic agriculture. California continues to be the leading state as a producer of organic crops in the United States, accounting for 12% of organic cropland and 50% of crop sales value (NASS USDA, 2020). California's unique Pesticide Use Report (PUR) database has very detailed and long-term data, which allows the identification of individual organic fields based on their historical pesticide use records. The PUR database contains information on all commercial agricultural pesticide use in California since 1995, including information on the chemicals used, crops and acreages for millions of individual applications. In total, >50,000 organic farms 120,000 organic fields were identified in the California from 1995 to 2015.

The PUR database has three merits in terms of studying organic agriculture. First, the organic crop production in California has a diverse crop portfolio which provides the opportunity to investigate how pesticide use and the consolidation process interact with changes in the crop mix. Fruits and vegetables received higher price premium compare to other organic produce (Carlson and Jaenicke, 2016), which creates different level of incentives for growers to adopt the organic production and apply pesticide. Secondly, the PUR database covers pesticide use information since 1995, which is 6 years before the launch of the National Organic Program (NOP). In Läpple and Van Rensburg (2011), the authors found that growers who entered organic production after the supporting policy was launched are more likely to be profit-driven and less environmentally concerned than growers who began organic production before any supporting policy was in place. The PUR database allows us to see the policy impact on pesticide use and cropland consolidation. Thirdly, the PUR database contains detailed location information, which is used by Zhan and Zhang (2012) to match with other geographic databases and calculate the environmental impacts on surface water, groundwater, soil, air, and pollinators from pesticide use. The environmental impact measure used in this study is more accurate and detailed than previous studies.

2. Data and Methods
In this section, we develop a method to identify organic fields and assess pesticide use in organic agriculture using the PUR database. Organic crop acreages identified from the PUR database are compared with data from other sources to discuss of our method. The Pesticide Use Risk Evaluation (PURE) index from (Zhan and Zhang, 2012) is used to evaluate the environmental impacts of pesticide usage. The impact of cropland consolidation on the pesticide use patterns and the environmental impacts of organic agriculture are quantified using the fixed-effect regression method.

2.1. The PUR Database on Pesticide Usage and Crop Fields
The main database used in this study is the PUR database, which contains detailed information on location, timing, amount and name of product applied, application methods, acreage treated, and crop treated. Since 1990, all agricultural pesticide use information in California has been collected by the County Agricultural Commissioners (CAC), who in turn, report it to the California Department of Pesticide Regulation (CDPR), which publishes the PUR database annually. The PUR database is the largest and most complete dataset on pesticide use in the world and it contains >3 million application records for agricultural use each year. Numerous studies in environmental science, plant pathology, and agricultural economics have been conducted based on the PUR database (Reynolds et al., 2005; Larsen et al., 2017; Davidson, 2004; Lybbert et al., 2016).

Non-chemical pest management practices, such as biological, cultural, and mechanical/physical controls, are not recorded in the PUR database. As a result, this study focuses only on the potential impacts posed by pesticide usage in organic agriculture. The PUR database from 1995 to 2017 were used in this study for two reasons. First, this time frame provides coverage before and after the launch of the National Organic Program (NOP) in 2001, which allows us to determine any effects of that policy change. Secondly, while the PUR database are available from 1990 onward, the data quality is known to be more variable in the early years (Wilhoit et al., 2001).

Pesticide use information in the PUR database is available at the field level. In this paper, a “field” is defined using two variables in the PUR database, “GROWER_ID” and “SITE_LOC_ID”. “GROWER_ID” is a number assigned to a grower or operator by CAC on their pesticide permit, and it remains constant for the same grower over time. “SITE_LOC_ID” is a code assigned by 5 CAC on the pesticide permit which indicates a particular location (field) where an application may occur. For a given field, this code may change from year to year, as it was assigned by growers, which creates some uncertainties in identifying organic fields across years. This uncertainty is accounted for in the analyses, as described below.

For each agricultural pesticide application, the PUR database specifies the location of application in the variable “COMTRS”, which stands for the county, meridian, township, range, and section as defined by the Public Lands Survey mapping system (PLSS). This information allows us to locate which section does the field belong and aggregate pesticide usage at the 1 × 1 mile PLSS section-level, which is the finest spatial scale reported in the PUR database. This detailed section-level analysis of the spatial distribution of organic fields in California and, how it has changed over time, is only possible using our method for identifying organic production fields in the PUR database.

In the PUR database, acreage information is recorded as both treated acreage and planted acreage. The former represents the acres physically treated in a pesticide application while the latter remains constant for the field within a year. However, previous experience with the PUR database by this research group has demonstrated that planted acreage is not consistently reliable for annual crops, so in this study, we use the maximum treated acreage in a given year as the acreage for each field for annual crops. This approach assumes that the entire field is treated with pesticide at least once per year. If this assumption is invalid, then the planted acreage will be under-counted. As presented below, the validity of this approach is supported by the consistency of state-scale crop acreages that are generated from the PUR database with those from other data sources.

One caveat of the PUR database for organic production is that since 2000, pesticide products deemed as having “minimum impacts” are no longer required to be registered with CDPR, which exempts them from the pesticide use reporting requirement. A detailed list of these pesticide ingredients can be found in the California Code of Regulations section 6147 (CDPR, 2000). 6 Most ingredients exempted from registration are natural or naturally-derived products (e.g., garlic oil), which could presumably be used in organic agriculture and have impacts on the surrounding environment. However, these exempted ingredients are not widely applied, based on their minimal amounts of usage in the PUR database prior to 2000 when they were still required to be reported. Therefore, this issue is not likely to invalidate our results, especially because the number of fields where only such ingredients were applied before 2000 is small.

For convenience, some chemically-related individual active ingredients (AIs) were grouped together, such as combining the many different strains of Bacillus thuringiensis, which target different insects and are each treated as a distinct AI in the PUR database, into a single “microbial” group. A detailed list of microbials is available in the appendix A. The group of “Copper, fixed” includes the summation of copper, copper oxychloride, copper octanoate, copper oxide, and copper hydroxide; and the two forms of copper sulfate (basic copper sulfate and copper sulfate pentahydrate).

2.2. Identifying Organic Fields from the PUR Database
Organic growers are required to comply with a set of crop management standards, regarding seeds and planting stock practices, soil fertility and crop nutrient management, pest, weed, and disease management, and crop rotation among others (NOP, 2001). The most relevant requirement for this study is that there is a 36-month transition period between the last application of any prohibited substance under organic regulations and officially recognized organic production. Our field identification method relies on this requirement. First, we constructed a list of allowed and prohibited substances based on various sources (as described in the appendix A). Second, we checked each field in the PUR database to see which AIs were applied over the past three years. If there were no applications of any prohibited ingredients, then the field was considered organic as of that year. Organic growers who do not use any chemical tools at all to manage pests and weeds are missing from the PUR database entirely, and therefore not identified in this study. However, 7 based on acreage comparisons between the PUR database and other data sources, those growers appear to operate a very limited number of acres.

Theoretically, a field could comply with the pest, weed, and disease management standards of the NOP while violating other standards (such as applying synthetic fertilizers) and still not qualify for organic production. Because the PUR database only contains pesticide use information, our method cannot distinguish such fields from actual certified organic fields. On the other hand, growers could follow organic farming practices but choose not to certify their fields for various reasons. However, as mentioned above, the amounts of acreage in these categories must not be very substantial because our PUR-derived organic crop acreages agree with those from CAC compiled sources, suggesting that our method is valid.

One caveat of this method is the consistency of field information in the PUR database from year to year. As mentioned previously, the “SITE_LOCATION_ID” on pesticide permits, a number chosen by growers or assigned by county, indicates a physical field location, but the ID number may change from year to year. When that ID changes, which happens for various reasons including land transaction between growers, a new “field” appears in the PUR database, for which we do not have information on its historical (i.e., over the previous three years) pesticide applications. In this situation, we assume for annual crops that the land was fallow until a new “SITE_LOCATION_ID” was assigned. Sample cost studies have shown that it is not profitable to produce under the organic standard without earning an organic price premium (Holtz et al., 2016; McGourty et al., 2016; Abraben et al., 2017).

This assumption could overestimate the organic acreage when a conventional field is given a new id and the grower use only pesticide AIs that are allowed in organic agriculture. We will verify this assumption by counting the share of organic allowed AIs used within a field every year. If conventional fields are never treated by only organic allowed AIs, then we can distinguish fields under difference status by using one-year of pesticide use record, which supports our assumption. Pasture and rangeland have unique pest management practices and enormous acreage, but they are not covered in this study as they do not suit our primary purpose of evaluating the environmental impacts of pesticide use in organic crop fields.

One could suggest to identify organic fields from the PUR database based on what pesticide products were used instead of AIs. Currently, pesticide manufacturers could register their products with two agencies at various costs, the Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI) and the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA), and obtain a label to show that their products are allowed to use in organic agriculture. The merit of this approach is to identify organic fields more precisely because certain pesticide products contain inert ingredients that are prohibited in organic agriculture which are categorized incorrectly if we only focus on AIs. However, this merit is no longer significant if conventional growers always use AIs that are prohibited in organic agriculture, which will be checked as mentioned before.

There are two disadvantages of using pesticide products to identify organic fields in the PUR database. First, not all pesticide products allowed in organic agriculture are registered. This is a significant drawback because our analysis started from 1995 but the first OMRI list was published in 1998 and earliest registration record from WSDA was in 1999. In addition, for products such as dusting sulfur, information asymmetry is not an issue because farmers are certain that they are allowed in organic agriculture, which makes product registrations not profitable. Second, products registered with OMRI and WSDA cannot be easily matched with products used in the PUR database. Product names slightly vary across systems. For example, product Nu-Film® P is called “MILLER NU-FILM-P"" in the PUR database, “Miller™ Nu Film® P Spreader Sticker” in the OMRI list, and “Nu Film P"" in the WSDA list. Both OMRI and WSDA lists do not provide EPA registration numbers, which is also missing for some products in the PUR database. More details about two products list are discussed in the appendix A. The main analysis will be repeated for fields treated with organic allowed pesticide product for three years to show results under different organic identification methods.

2.3. Other Data Sources for Organic Acreage
To test the validity of our method for identifying organic fields, we compared organic acreages derived from the PUR database with those available in other data sources, primarily from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA). The acreage data in each source were collected using different approaches and therefore it is common to observe differences.

2.3.1. CDFA Organic Registration Data
The California Organic Products Act requires an annual registration of all organic producers, handlers, and processors, regardless of their annual sales. Producers report acreage and total sales, expected or actual, for each crop they grow organically. Data for 1998 to 2016 have been summarized to the state-crop level in previous studies (Klonsky and Richter, 2005a; Klonsky and Richter, 2005b; Klonsky and Richter, 2011; Klonsky and Healy, 2013; Wei et al., 2020). After 2018, the registration data was summarized at county-crop level for a limited number of crop categories (CDFA, 2020). An acreage comparison is made for 2019 in appendix A.

2.3.2. USDA Certification and Organic Survey Data
The USDA's Economic Research Service (ERS) collected acreage data for seven crops at the state level from USDA-accredited state and private organic certifiers between 2000 and 2011 (ERS, 2011). However, the data only cover seven crops/crop groups and certified organic growers (growers with less than $ 5000 annual organic sales are exempted from certification). Meanwhile, USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) conducted five organic surveys between 1995 and 2017, which gathered organic crop acreage at the state level. However, responses to those surveys were voluntary and the average response rate for California was 69% (NASS USDA, 2010; NASS USDA, 2016b; NASS USDA, 2016a; NASS USDA, 2017). Therefore, we used the NASS survey data only when the USDA ERS data series were not available to construct the crop acreage data series.

2.3.3. California Strawberry Commission (CSC) Survey Data
For strawberries, the CSC collects organic data through its annual survey (CSC, 2021). The CSC data provide other information in addition to acreage and total sales, such as strawberry varieties and harvest timing. The response rate for this survey is unknown, which limits our understanding of its data quality. All three of these data sources were aggregated by crop (for the limited number of crops they include) or county, and individual field-level data are not available publicly. This limitation underscores the value of the PUR database and our method for providing unique information regarding organic crop production in California over space and time.

2.4. Assessing Potential Environmental Impacts of Pesticide Use
For pesticide applications on the identified organic fields in the PUR database, the PURE index was used to assess the potential environmental impacts (Zhan and Zhang, 2012). The PURE index is calculated for five different environmental dimensions: surface water, groundwater, soil, air, and pollinators. Individual index values are normalized to range from 0 (negligible impact) to 100 (highest impact).

For surface water, groundwater, soil, and pollinators, index values are calculated based on predicted environmental concentrations and standard toxicity values for endpoint organisms. The toxicity is commonly measured by the half maximal effective concentration (EC50), which is the dissolved concentration (mg/L) needed for a response halfway between the baseline and maximum lethality. A larger EC50 is associated with a less toxic chemical.

For surface water, the PURE index value is determined mainly by toxicities of AIs to aquatic organisms. The PURE soil index value is estimated based specifically on the toxicity for earthworms, which is measured by the dose that is lethal to 50% of the test population (LC50). The PURE index value for air is determined by the level of Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions. PURE index values are not directly comparable across different environmental aspects because the endpoint organisms are not the same.

The PURE index values are calculated for each AI in each pesticide application for each field. These AI-level disaggregated index values are then summed at the field-level, within each environmental aspect, to provide an overall assessment.

The algorithm of the PURE index assumes fields are heterogeneous across sections and includes the PLSS-level environmental variables for calculation. For example, fields that locate in sections closer to the river will have a greater PURE index score regarding surface water comparing to fields locate in other section when holding everything else constant. This is a major advantage of the PURE index over other methods commonly used in the literature for assessing the environmental impacts of pesticide use, such as the Environmental Impact Quotient (Kovach et al., 1992) or the pesticide load (Möhring et al., 2021).

2.5. Consolidation of Organic Cropland and its Impact on Pesticide Use
The consolidation of cropland into larger operations has been a persistent phenomenon in conventional agriculture since the 1930s (Gardner, 2009; Hart et al., 2003; MacDonald et al., 2018). Changes in farm size, measured in acreage, may create environmental concerns due to the differing production practices in larger and smaller operations. The empirical strategy of this paper has three parts: (1) First, we will estimate the correlation between organic farm size and environmental impacts of pesticide use; (2) Then, we will discuss changes in the overall pesticide use behavior by focusing on the total pesticides used per acre and the total treated acreage per acre as organic farm size changes;(3) Finally, we will study the use of particular pesticide AIs, including total amount, intensity, and frequency, that differs in larger and smaller organic farms. Together, our empirical strategy aims to identify the effect of farm size on environmental impacts of pesticide use and links it to specific pesticide use behaviors that vary across farms with difference acreage. The overall effects of farm acreage on the environmental impacts is identified using the following regression model:
(1)
where 
 is the one of the PURE index values in field 
 at year 
. The variable of interest is 
, which represents the total organic acreage, measured in units of 1000 acres, operated by grower 
 who manages field 
 at year 
. The years of farming observed in the PUR database for grower 
 is 
. There are three fixed effects in this model: grower fixed effect 
, year fixed effect 
, and crop fixed effect 
. Eq. 1 is also use to estimate the correlation between farm size and the overall pesticide use, where 
 is the total pesticide used per acre and the total acreage treated per acre. Environmental variables such as rainfall are not included in the model because the PURE index values are calculated based on those environmental conditions.

The standard error is clustered at grower level which assumes the decision making process of pesticide application is correlated across fields that are managed by the same grower but independent across growers. This assumption is based on the fact that most pesticide products and certain pesticide application equipment and services can be shared across fields and crops. Researchers have found that the usage of pesticides and fertilizers is correlated between growers Conley and Udry (2010).

Including the fixed effects and the farming experience variable help to mitigate the bias caused by the existence of unobserved factors (and therefore omitted variables) that influence the outcomes of interest. The data collecting process of the PUR database is designed to keep growers' identity confidential, which poses obstacles for researches. We cannot not retrieve information such as gender, age, and perceptions of environmental issues, which are commonly used in studies focused on pesticide use or organic farming. One could conduct surveys personally and match the results with the PUR database as in Lybbert et al. (2016). However, that approach often times is restricted by funding limits and hard to provide a broad view of topic of interests. We add a grower fixed effect in the model, which captures grower-level characteristics that remain unchanged over time, such as gender. Since grower id contains county information in the PUR database, the grower fixed effect also serves as a county fixed effect which helps to absorb differences across counties.

Pesticide use is determined by pest population which varies from year to year due to temperature and precipitation changes. The farm size is governed by the equilibrium prices which also changes over time. The year fixed effect in the model will capture such co-movement so that it does not bias the estimation of 
. Farm acreage and pesticide portfolio are difference across crops. Field crops such as rice are generally cultivated at a large scale and require less pesticide comparing to fruit crops such as strawberries. The crop fixed effect included in the model ensures that our estimations reveal the correlation between farm size and pesticide use within crops. Together the grower, crop, and year fixed effects serve the same purpose of helping to mitigate the omitted variables bias. A robustness check is included to show estimation results under different combinations of fixed effects.

For a particular AI/AI group, the pesticide use behavior can be measured by two variables: (1) the frequency of pesticide applications and (2) the intensity of pesticide use in each application. The correlation between organic farm acreage and use of particular pesticide AIs is identified using the following regression model with the grower, year, and crop fixed effects:
(2)
where 
 is the total pesticide used per acre, the number of applications per field, and the application rate of AI/AI group 
 in field 
 at year 
. The application rate measures the use intensity, which is defined as the total pounds of pesticide used divided by the total treated acreage for each field and AI/AI group. For example, if the field is 2 acres and it is sprayed three times a year with 5 pounds of AI each time, then total AI used is 15 pounds, the total treated acreage 6 acres, and the application rate is 2.5. Together, the number of applications and the application rate capture the pesticide use behavior.

The correlation between organic farm size and different measures of pesticide use is conducted for fields treated with AIs allowed in organic agriculture for three years as well as one year. The same estimation is repeated for fields treated with pesticide products allowed in organic agriculture for three years. As a robustness check, results are compared for organic fields identified under difference criteria.

3. Results and Discussion
This section presents data on the organic fields identified from the PUR database along with acreage summary for the top organic crops. The comparisons of organic acreages reported in different data sources are made to examine the validity of our approach. The environmental impacts for pesticides used on organic fields are assessed using the PURE index. Finally, the trend of cropland consolidation is presented and the effect of consolidation on pesticide use and the environmental impacts are quantified.

3.1. Organic Fields Identified in the PUR Database
Fig. 1 maps organic fields identified from the PUR database for all crops. Each pixel represents a section with any organic acreage. They are color-coded based on the number of organic acres in that section. Organic fields were more widespread in 2017 (Fig. 2B) than in 1995 (Fig. 2A). The number of sections with organic cropland increased from 1451 to 3008. Also, there was a pronounced shift toward more organic acreage within sections. By definition, each section contains 640 acres of cropland at a maximum. In 1995, only 5% of sections had >100 acres of organic cropland, which increased to 18% in 2017. In particular, substantial growth 15 was observed in Monterey, Fresno, and Imperial counties (outlined in red). Monterey County has the most organic acreage and the greatest number of sections with organic fields, increasing from 54 sections in 1995 to 202 sections in 2017. The top five organic crops in Monterey (leaf lettuce, spinach, broccoli, strawberry, and celery) accounted for 73% of total organic acreage in 2017. As the leading county, Monterey had 47% of the state's organic lettuce and 61% of California's organic strawberry acreage in 2017. Details on total organic acreage, average farm size, and number of organic farms for each county are available in the appendix A.

Fig. 2. Histogram of fields by the share of organic allowed AIs in all AIs used.

To valid our approach using AIs to identify organic fields in the PUR database, we count, for each field-year, the number AIs used and the number of organic allowed AIs used, which give us the share of organic allowed AIs in all AIs used. If the share equals to 1, all AIs used in that field are allowed in organic agriculture.

Fig. 2 shows that 40% of fields are located at the left end of the horizontal axis, which means none of the organic allowed AI was used in those fields. The pesticide AI portfolio is very different between conventional and organic fields, which makes AI an appropriate criterion to distinguish organic fields from conventional ones.

Table 1 shows organic acreage for the top 10 crops (ranked by organic acreage in 2015) during the 21-year period from 1995 to 2015 and the total crop acreage for both conventional and organic production in 2015. Eight of the ten crops are fruits and vegetables. The remaining two are rice and almonds. Overall, the total organic acreage of these crops grew from 46,884 acres in 1995 to 162,389 acres in 2015, an increase of more than threefold.

Abstract
Bees carry out vital ecosystem services by pollinating both wild and economically important crop plants. However, while performing this function, bee pollinators may encounter potentially harmful xenobiotics in the environment such as pesticides (fungicides, herbicides and insecticides). Understanding the key factors that influence the toxicological outcomes of bee exposure to these chemicals, in isolation or combination, is essential to safeguard their health and the ecosystem services they provide. In this regard, recent work using toxicogenomic and phylogenetic approaches has begun to identify, at the molecular level, key determinants of pesticide sensitivity in bee pollinators. These include detoxification systems that convert pesticides to less toxic forms and key residues in insecticide target-sites that underlie species-specific insecticide selectivity. Here we review this emerging body of research and summarise the state of knowledge of the molecular determinants of pesticide sensitivity in bee pollinators. We identify gaps in our knowledge for future research and examine how an understanding of the genetic basis of bee sensitivity to pesticides can be leveraged to, a) predict and avoid negative bee-pesticide interactions and facilitate the future development of pest-selective bee-safe insecticides, and b) inform traditional effect assessment approaches in bee pesticide risk assessment and address issues of ecotoxicological concern.

1. Introduction
Bees are a group of hymenopteran insects comprising approximately 20,000 described species (Michener, 2007). Bees are the world's most economically and environmentally important group of insect pollinators with 35 % of global food production dependent on their pollination services (Klein et al., 2007). Unfortunately, many bee species have been declining over recent decades threatening these essential ecosystem services (Potts et al., 2016; Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhuys, 2019; Wagner et al., 2021). The possible reasons for these declines are complex and include habitat loss, climate change, parasites and pathogens, and pesticides (Wagner et al., 2021). In the case of pesticides, as insects, bee species may be particularly vulnerable to insecticides, and certain insecticides (e.g. certain neonicotinoids) have been banned in Europe after a review of their risk to bee health by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) (Bass and Field, 2018). However, as a group, insecticides currently play a key role in controlling insect disease vectors and securing quality and yield in plant production, and will remain an important component of integrated pest and vector management programs in the future. Given this, to safeguard the health of bee pollinators, it is essential that we understand the key factors that influence the toxicological outcome of insect exposure to these chemicals.

While bees have only been exposed to human-made pesticides over the recent past (last 80 years) they have co-evolved with plants and fungi which produce a range of xenobiotics, including plant allelochemicals and mycotoxins. This has led to the evolution of sophisticated systems that allow bees to detoxify or circumvent the natural xenobiotics they encounter in their environment (Berenbaum and Johnson, 2015; Gong and Diao, 2017; Johnson, 2015). These systems may have the potential to be co-opted to protect bees from certain synthetic pesticides if there is sufficient structural similarity between natural and synthetic xenobiotics. This is made more likely by that fact that, many pesticides, such as the neonicotinoids and pyrethroids, are derivatives of natural plant allelochemicals (Casida and Durkin, 2013).

Interestingly, recent work has shown that bees can exhibit profound variation in their sensitivity to different insecticides – including to compounds belonging to the same class (Beadle et al., 2019; Iwasa et al., 2004; Manjon et al., 2018; Reid et al., 2020) (Fig. 1). For example, honeybees (Apis mellifera) are >1000-fold less sensitive to the neonicotinoid thiacloprid than the neonicotinoid imidacloprid in acute contact bioassays (Iwasa et al., 2004) with the former classified as ‘highly toxic’ but the latter categorised as ‘practically non-toxic’ according to the official categories of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA et al., 2014). In another example, while many pyrethroid insecticides are highly toxic to insect pollinators, others, such as tau-fluvalinate, display such low acute toxicity to bees that they are used as in-hive treatments by beekeepers against parasitic Varroa mites (Mao et al., 2011). In contrast, the leaf-cutting bee Megachile rotundata is highly sensitive to many insecticides tested so far, including compounds categorised as moderately and practically non-toxic to honeybees, such as the cyano-substituted neonicotinoid insecticides acetamiprid and thiacloprid and the synthetic pyrethroid insecticide tau-fluvalinate. Why are some bees highly tolerant to some insecticides but not others, and what are the specific mechanisms that underpin this differential sensitivity? Recent toxicogenomic work has begun to address this question and identify the key factors that determine pesticide sensitivity in bee pollinators. In this review we summarise the current state of knowledge on this topic. We frame our review by addressing two primary questions: What are the molecular determinants of pesticide sensitivity in bee pollinators? How can an understanding of these factors be leveraged to predict and avoid negative bee-pesticide interactions, and inform bee pollinator pesticide risk assessment?

Toxicity thresholds are depicted according to the Environmental Protection Agency toxicity ratings.

2. Mechanisms
A variety of different mechanisms have been implicated in the tolerance of bees to specific pesticides, and thus as determinants of insecticide sensitivity, these include metabolic detoxification, insecticide target proteins, the insect cuticle and bee gut microbiota. These mechanisms are illustrated in Fig. 2 and described in detail below.

Fig. 2. Schematic of determinants of insecticide sensitivity in bees. Four different mechanisms have been associated with the tolerance of bees to specific pesticides including: (A) metabolic detoxification (most notably by P450s expressed in the Malpighian tubules, the gut or the brain), (B) insecticide target proteins (in this example in the bee nervous system), (C) the insect cuticle, and, (D) the gut microbiota of bees.

2.1. Metabolic detoxification
The role of metabolic detoxification in bee sensitivity to pesticides was first implicated by the observation that pyrethroid insecticides such as lambda-cyhalothrin are more toxic to honeybees in the presence of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (P450)-inhibiting fungicides, such as prochloraz (Colin and Belzunces, 1992; Pilling and Jepson, 1993). The mechanism by which prochloraz enhances pyrethroid toxicity was subsequently investigated by following the metabolism of radiolabelled lambda-cyhalothrin in whole bees and dissected midguts (Pilling et al., 1995). The metabolites identified were consistent with both esterase- and P450-mediated detoxification, and (especially oxidative) metabolism was found to be strongly inhibited in the presence of prochloraz. This provided further evidence that this fungicide enhances pyrethroid toxicity to honeybees as a result of inhibition of P450 and/or esterase metabolism (Pilling et al., 1995; Pilling and Jepson, 1993). Subsequent studies investigated the involvement of major detoxification enzyme systems in the differential tolerance of honeybees to different pyrethroid, organophosphate and neonicotinoid chemotypes using inhibitors of P450s (piperonyl butoxide, PBO), GSTs (diethyl maleate, DEM) and esterases (S,S,S-tributylphosphorotrithioate, DEF) (Iwasa et al., 2004; Johnson et al., 2009; Johnson et al., 2006). In the case of pyrethroids, toxicity was most profoundly synergized by PBO, implicating P450s in detoxification (Johnson et al., 2006). Furthermore, much greater synergism of the pyrethroid tau-fluvalinate (980-fold), which exhibits low acute toxicity to honeybees, was observed than for cyfluthrin (30-fold) and lambda-cyhalothrin (80-fold), which are extremely toxic to honeybees (Johnson et al., 2006). Similar work on the organophosphate coumaphos, used as an in-hive treatment against Varroa mites, showed that DEF and PBO synergised the toxicity of coumaphos to honeybees, enhancing toxicity 2.8-fold and 4.0-fold, respectively. Finally, in the case of neonicotinoids, PBO was found to increase the toxicity of acetamiprid and thiacloprid, which exhibit low acute toxicity to honeybees, 244- and 1141-fold, respectively, but had minimal effect on imidacloprid (1.85-fold) which is highly toxic to bees (Iwasa et al., 2004). Similar work on other bee species implicated P450 metabolism in the chemotype-specific neonicotinoid tolerance of both bumble bees, Bombus terrestris, and red mason bees, Osmia bicornis (Beadle et al., 2019; Manjon et al., 2018; Reid et al., 2020).

In addition to synergism studies, the role of P450s in the differential toxicity of different neonicotinoid insecticides was also evidenced by studies examining the in vivo distribution and metabolisation of [14C]-imidacloprid and [14C]-acetamiprid in honeybees (Brunet et al., 2005; Suchail et al., 2004). For both compounds, the profile of metabolites produced was consistent with the biotransformation of these compounds by P450s. However, the kinetics of metabolism suggested the low toxicity of acetamiprid may result, in part, from its much faster metabolism (Brunet et al., 2005). This has been confirmed by a recent pharmacokinetic study investigating the metabolic fate in honeybees of [14C]-labelled neonicotinoids, including acetamiprid and thiacloprid, after topical application (Zaworra et al., 2019). Together, these results provided a first line of evidence that P450s play an important role in bee sensitivity to pyrethroid and neonicotinoid insecticides and may be especially important in the detoxification of chemotypes that exhibit low toxicity to bees.

Following the implication of P450s as determinants of insecticide sensitivity in bee pollinators, research turned to identification of the specific P450 gene(s) involved in insecticide metabolism. In a landmark study Mao et al. successfully functionally expressed eight honeybee P450s, and showed that three of these, CYP9Q1, CYP9Q2, and CYP9Q3, metabolise tau-fluvalinate and coumaphos (Mao et al., 2011). While not specifically identifying these P450s as determinants of the low toxicity of these insecticides to honeybees, this study was important as it identified specific insecticide metabolising P450s of honeybees for the first time. Mao et al. also showed that tau-fluvalinate exposure can induce CYP9Q3 expression (by ?1.5-fold) (Mao et al., 2011). While the biological relevance of this modest change in expression is unclear, this finding suggested that it may be possible to identify bee P450s involved in the metabolism of other insecticides by using them as inducers of P450 gene expression, which could then be identified by transcriptome profiling. Indeed, this strategy has been employed to investigate the molecular basis of the low toxicity of thiacloprid to honeybees (Alptekin et al., 2016). Alptekin et al. showed that a measurable reduction in thiacloprid sensitivity could be induced in honeybees after exposure to a sublethal dose of this neonicotinoid for 24 h and correlated this with the induction of five P450 genes, CYP6BE1, CYP305D1, CYP6AS5, CYP315A1 and CYP301A1, and a carboxyl/cholinesterase (CCE), CCE8, using microarray analysis. However, functional expression of four of these P450s and assessment of their ability to metabolise thiacloprid by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis failed to provide any evidence of their ability to detoxify this insecticide. Manjon et al. therefore took a different approach, conducting an ambitious functional analysis of 27 of the 46 honeybee P450s, comprising the entire CYP3 clan (Manjon et al., 2018). This revealed that P450s belonging to the CYP9Q subfamily, most notably CYP9Q3, metabolise thiacloprid (and acetamiprid) with high efficiency but have limited activity against imidacloprid, providing a molecular explanation for the profound difference in honeybee sensitivity to N-nitroguanidine and N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoids. Work on bumble bees (B. terrestris) identified CYP9Q4 and CYP9Q6 as functional orthologs of honeybee CYP9Q3 and key metabolic determinants of neonicotinoid sensitivity in this species (Manjon et al., 2018; Troczka et al., 2019). Follow on work on the solitary red mason bee, O. bicornis, revealed that a P450 within the CYP9BU subfamily (CYP9BU1), with recent shared ancestry to the Apidae CYP9Q subfamily, metabolises thiacloprid in vitro and confers tolerance in vivo (Beadle et al., 2019).

Flupyradifurone and chlorantraniliprole are butenolide and diamide insecticides, respectively, which are considered moderately to practically non-toxic to honeybees based on acute contact and oral toxicity assays (EFSA, 2015; EFSA, 2013). Screening of the panel of 27 CYP3 clan P450s of honeybee against flupyradifurone identified three P450s involved in the detoxification of this compound: CYP6AQ1, CYP9Q2 and CYP9Q3 (Haas et al., 2021). Furthermore, transgenic Drosophila melanogaster lines ectopically expressing CYP9Q2 and CYP9Q3 were significantly less sensitive to flupyradifurone than control flies of the same genetic background without a transgene, demonstrating that these P450s confer resistance to this compound in vivo (Haas et al., 2021). In the case of chlorantraniliprole, similar work revealed that transgenic Drosophila lines expressing CYP9Q2 and CYP9Q3 exhibit enhanced resistance to this compound in insecticide bioassays and demonstrated that recombinant CYP9Q2 and CYP9Q3 have the capacity to metabolise chlorantraniliprole (Haas et al., 2022a).

In combination the studies detailed above reveal that members of the CYP9Q subfamily of P450s have the capacity to metabolise compounds belonging to five different insecticide classes (pyrethroids, organophosphates, neonicotinoids, diamides and butenolides). This suggests that a handful of key P450s are critically important in defining the sensitivity of managed bees to pesticides. This finding has parallels with P450-mediated xenobiotic detoxification in humans, where two of the 57 functional P450s (CYP3A4 and CYP2D6) are responsible for the metabolism of approximately 40 % of clinically used drugs (Rendic and Guengerich, 2015).

The demonstration of the key role of CYP9Q/CYP9BU1 P450s (termed ‘CYP9Q-type’ hereafter) in defining the sensitivity of managed bee pollinators to insecticides led to several important questions on the potential importance of these enzymes across the wide diversity of >20,000 bee species. These include: 1) What is the level of evolutionary conservation of CYP9Q-type P450s in bees? 2) Do CYP9Q-type P450s from a broad range of bee species have the conserved capacity to detoxify certain insecticides? 3) If the presence of insecticide-degrading P450 enzymes is not universal to all bee species, what are the implications of this for insecticide sensitivity in species that lack these enzymes? Recent work has exploited the dramatic increase in bee genomic resources to address these questions. Haas et al. used a phylogenomic approach to identify >100 putative CYP9Q functional orthologs across 75 bee species encompassing all major bee families, revealing that the presence of CYP9Q-type P450s is generally well conserved across the diversity of bees (Haas et al., 2022b). Furthermore, functional analysis of 26 P450s from 20 representative bee species in this study revealed an evolutionarily conserved capacity of CYP9Q-type P450s to metabolise certain insecticides (including thiacloprid and flupyradifurone) across all major bee families (Haas et al., 2022b). However, CYP9Q-type genes were not found to be ubiquitous in all bee species in this study, with some Megachilidae species lacking such genes (Haas et al., 2022b). A follow-on study investigating the evolution and function of P450s in the Megachilidae in more detail revealed that several Megachilidae species, belonging to the Lithurgini, Megachilini and Anthidini tribes, including all species of the Megachile genus investigated, lack CYP9Q-type genes (Hayward et al., 2023). In contrast, species from the Osmiini and Dioxyini tribes of Megachilidae have CYP9Q-type P450s belonging to the CYP9BU subfamily. Furthermore, these P450s are able to detoxify thiacloprid (Beadle et al., 2019; Haas et al., 2022b; Hayward et al., 2023). Phylogenetic and syntenic analyses revealed that Megachile species have evolved phylogenetically distinct CYP9 genes, the CYP9DM lineage, in place of CYP9Q-type genes, and functional expression of these P450s from Megachile rotundata revealed they lack the capacity to metabolise thiacloprid and imidacloprid (Hayward et al., 2023). Consistent with this finding, native microsomes (a source of total cytochrome P450 enzymes localized to the endoplasmic reticulum) of this species were shown to have the capacity to metabolise the natural insecticide nicotine but not the neonicotinoid insecticides imidacloprid and thiacloprid, or the butenolide insecticide flupyradifurone or the pyrethroid insecticide tau-fluvalinate (Hayward et al., 2019). The implications of the loss of CYP9Q-type genes in M. rotundata was investigated using acute contact insecticide bioassays and revealed that this species is up to >2500-fold more sensitive to insecticides which are detoxified by CYP9Q-type enzymes in honeybees, bumblebees and red mason bees (Hayward et al., 2023; Hayward et al., 2019). Furthermore, while the three latter bee species exhibit marked differences (500–2000-fold) in their sensitivity to thiacloprid and imidacloprid only a 15-fold difference was observed in the sensitivity of M. rotundata to these two neonicotinoids (Hayward et al., 2019). These results clearly demonstrate that the intrinsic tolerance of other managed bee pollinators to certain insecticide chemotypes is not observed in M. rotundata and provides additional evidence of the role of CYP9Q-type P450s as key determinants of insecticide sensitivity.

Given the demonstrated importance of CYP9Q-type P450s in bee tolerance to pesticides, it is important to understand when and where these P450s are expressed in bees and how this might impact bee sensitivity to pesticides. Investigation of the spatial expression profile of CYP9Q/CYP9BU P450 genes in honeybees, bumblebees and red mason bees revealed high levels of expression in the Malpighian tubules and brain (Beadle et al., 2019; Manjon et al., 2018; Troczka et al., 2019). The expression of these P450s in Malpighian tubules, which are key osmoregulatory and detoxifying organs in many insect species, is consistent with a primary role in xenobiotic metabolism, while expression in the brain suggests a secondary or additional site of detoxification against xenobiotics that cross the blood-brain barrier. In another study, expression of CYP9Q1–3 in antennae of adult honeybee workers performing different tasks revealed that CYP9Q3 expression differed significantly according to age-related task performance, with low levels of expression in the antennae of newly eclosed workers, increasing to significantly higher levels in nurses and even higher levels in foragers (Mao et al., 2015). CYP9Q1 and CYP9Q2 expression was also higher in nurses and foragers than newly eclosed workers but no significant difference in expression was observed between nurses and foragers (Mao et al., 2015). The pattern of expression of CYP9Q1–3 observed in honeybee legs was similar, increasing significantly with each behavioural stage (Mao et al., 2015). The finding that expression of CYP9Q2 and CYP9Q3 is highest in foragers is consistent with a role in xenobiotic protection as this behavioural stage is most like to routinely encounter phytochemicals while collecting nectar, pollen and resin. Recent work has characterized the gene expression profile of the inventory of detoxification genes in honeybees by analysing 47 transcriptomes across the honeybee life cycle, including different larval instars, pupae, and adults (Maiwald et al., 2023). This confirmed the results of earlier work on the tissue- and behavioural stage-specific expression pattern of CYP9Q P450 genes while also revealing a trend of incremental upregulation in developing larval stages until pupation and a marked increase in expression levels in adult stages. This finding supports the idea that these P450s are involved in the elimination of xenobiotics encountered by active life stages of honeybees. Related to this, CYP9Q3 expression was shown to be strongly induced by constituents of honey and pollen, such as p-coumaric acid, that the active life stages of honeybees are exposed to (Mao et al., 2013). Furthermore, when p-coumaric acid was added to a diet of sucrose and fed to honeybees it was found to increase midgut metabolism of coumaphos by ?60 % demonstrating the functional significance of its effect as an inducer of P450 expression (Mao et al., 2013). Recent studies suggest that the influence of phytochemicals on the metabolic capacity towards pesticides is a broader phenomenon, probably based on the induction of detoxification genes such as P450s (Ardalani et al., 2021b; Ardalani et al., 2021a).

In addition to quantitative changes in the expression of CYP9Q-type P450s, recent work has provided evidence that qualitative variation in the sequence of these P450s in bee populations may also impact insecticide detoxification and bee tolerance (Tsvetkov et al., 2023). Previous work has shown that honeybee genotype can influence tolerance to neonicotinoids. For example, Rinkevich et al. examined the sensitivity of honeybees of different genetic backgrounds (Carniolan, Italian, and Russian stocks) to three insecticides and identified a < 1-fold difference in sensitivity to organophosphates, moderate differences in bioassays with pyrethroids (1.5- to 3-fold) and marked differences in neonicotinoid sensitivity (3.4- to 33.3-fold) (Rinkevich et al., 2015). More recently, Tsvetkov et al. investigated the genetic basis of neonicotinoid sensitivity in honeybees and showed that the survival of honeybee workers to an acute oral dose of clothianidin is heritable, with H2 = 0.38 (Tsvetkov et al., 2023). Tolerance to clothianidin was not associated with differences in the expression of CYP9Q-type P450s, however, mutations in CYP9Q1 and CYP9Q3 were strongly associated with worker survival following clothianidin exposure. More specifically nine mutations across seven haplotypes were identified for CYP9Q3 and five mutations in six haplotypes for CYP9Q1. To date, the ability of CYP9Q-type P450s to metabolise clothianidin has not been demonstrated, and this, and the impact of the identified mutations on metabolism, requires functional validation. Nevertheless, the demonstration of genetic variation in CYP9Q-type P450s of bee populations in this study is important, as previous work on pest insects has demonstrated that standing genetic variation in P450s of insect pest populations can be rapidly selected by insecticide exposure leading to resistance (Zimmer et al., 2018).

Only a handful of P450s beyond CYP9Q-type P450s have been implicated in insecticide metabolism in bees. The most well characterized example comes from recent work on the CYP336 family of cytochrome P450s and their role in protecting bees (and other hymenopteran species) from nicotine – a potent natural insecticide produced by plants (especially Solanaceae) (Haas et al., 2023). Honeybees are much more tolerant to this alkaloid than many insect pest species (Human et al., 2014; Steppuhn et al., 2004), with recent studies linking this tolerance to rapid and efficient metabolism in adults and larvae (du Rand et al., 2017b; du Rand et al., 2017a; du Rand et al., 2015). Investigation of the metabolic fate of nicotine in honeybees using radiolabelled nicotine and LC-MS/MS analysis provided evidence that nicotine is metabolised by P450–mediated C?2-oxidation of the pyrrolidine ring of this compound (du Rand et al., 2017b). Screening of the 27 honeybee P450s of the CYP3 clan for their capacity to metabolise nicotine identified just four P450s that exhibited a degree of activity against this compound (CYP9P2, CYP9Q1, CYP6AQ1 and CYP336A1) (Haas et al., 2023). However, marked differences in activity were observed for the different P450s, CYP9P2 and CYP9Q1, exhibiting basal activity (2.8 and 6.4 % depletion of 10 ?M nicotine in 2 h), CYP6AQ1 exhibiting greater activity (22 % depletion), while CYP336A1 was the only P450 to deplete 10 ?M nicotine entirely (i.e., 100 % depletion). Further investigation of the substrate profile of CYP336A1 demonstrated that it can metabolise other alkaloids containing a basic nitrogen such as pyridine and tropane alkaloids that are closely related to nicotine from a biosynthetic perspective and appear in the same plant families, revealing this P450 is adapted to cope with concurrent alkaloid chemotypes (Haas et al., 2023). Remarkably, phylogenetic and syntenic analyses revealed that the CYP336 P450 family appears to be specific to Hymenoptera and highly conserved in this order, with representative genes found in all major hymenopteran lineages encompassing sawflies, wasps, ants, and bees. Furthermore, functional analysis of seven genes from four representative hymenopteran species that diverged over 281 million years revealed a conserved capacity to metabolise nicotine and related alkaloids. Using three-dimensional modelling and site-directed mutagenesis, CYP336A1 activity against basic alkaloids was linked to an aspartic acid residue (position 298) within the main access channel of CYP336 enzymes that is highly conserved within this P450 family (Haas et al., 2023). Remarkably, modification of this single residue completely abolished the metabolic activity of CYP336A1 against nicotine and atropine, revealing that D298 is a key determinant of the specific activity of the CYP336 family for protonated alkaloids. These findings demonstrate that insects from the same order, but with contrasting lifestyles, can recruit similar, conserved mechanisms to deal with potentially toxic plant allelochemicals. They also provide an example of the identification of a key structure-function determinant of P450-mediated insecticide metabolism at the amino acid level.

Beyond studies on CYP336 P450s and plant nectar alkaloids, it has been shown that members of the CYP6AS subfamily in honeybees metabolise flavonoids such as quercetin (Mao et al., 2009). This P450 subfamily has undergone substantial lineage specific expansion in a number of bee species, including A. mellifera (16 CYP6AS genes), Melipona quadrifasciata (a neotropical stingless bee; 17 CYP6AS genes) and M. rotundata (10 CYP6AS genes), which has been hypothesized to be a result from increased evolutionary exposure to a diverse range of flavonoids in nectar and pollen (Johnson et al., 2018). Computational homology modelling and docking studies with A. mellifera CYP6AS paralogs supported a role in flavonoid metabolism, which has been confirmed in substrate depletion studies with recombinantly expressed honeybee CYP6AS enzymes (Mao et al., 2009).

Work on Apis cerana cerana identified five P450 genes (named Acc301A1, Acc303A1, Acc306A1, Acc315A1, and AccCYP6k1 by the authors) that were induced by several insecticides (Tan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2019). RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Acc301A1, Acc303A1, Acc306A1 and AccCYP6k1 expression significantly increased the mortality rate of A. c. cerana to pesticide treatment. However, P450 genes may have important endogenous functions. Thus, silencing such genes can reduce the overall fitness of dsRNA treated bees, which may, in turn, result in increased sensitivity to subsequent exposure to insecticides even if the gene of interest does not directly confer resistance. Furthermore, the CYPome of A. cerana was recently shown to include P450s of the CYP9Q subfamily (Haas et al., 2022b). Thus, further functional validation of the role of these non-CYP9Q-type P450s as determinants of insecticide sensitivity is required.

Finally, as detailed above, CYP6AQ1 was shown to be an important player in flupyradifurone metabolism in honeybees (Haas et al., 2021). In contrast to honeybee CYP9Q2 and CYP9Q3, this enzyme selectively hydroxylated flupyradifurone, and no metabolites other than flupyradifurone-hydroxy were formed by the activity of recombinantly expressed CYP6AQ1. Very recently Xiao et al. followed a toxicogenomics approach and investigated the potential role of functional CYP6AQ1 orthologs in flupyradifurone metabolism from eight different bee species, including stingless bees (Tribe: Meliponini) such as the neotropical species Frieseomelitta varia and M. quadrifasciata (Brazil) (Xiao et al., 2023). Recombinant expression of functional orthologs of honeybee CYP6AQ1, such as CYP6AQ56 (M. quadrifasciata) and CYP6AQ84 (Tetragonula carbonaria, a stingless bee endemic in Australia) revealed a common coumarin substrate profile and a conserved capacity of all CYP6AQ1-like orthologs to metabolise flupyradifurone by hydroxylation in vitro. This study highlights the significance of investigating the detoxification mechanisms of insecticides in non-Apis bee species by molecular means to potentially inform risk assessment and conservation efforts.

2.2. Insecticide target-sites
The sensitivity of bees to different insecticides within the same mode of action class can also reside in differences in the affinity of these insecticides for their target sites. An excellent example of this is for pyrethroid insecticides, which act on insect voltage-gated sodium channels. Wu et al. examined the sensitivity of the sodium channel (BiNav1–1) of common Eastern bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) to different pyrethroid insecticides by expression in Xenopus oocytes and electrophysiological assays (Wu et al., 2017). While BiNav1–1 was found to be highly sensitive to six commonly used pyrethroids, it was found to be significantly less sensitive to tau-fluvalinate. Specifically, based on calculated EC25 values, BiNav1–1 was 10- to 12-fold more tolerant to tau-fluvalinate than to type I pyrethroids tested, and 24- to 31-fold more tolerant compared to other type II pyrethroids. Additional assays revealed that BiNav1–1 is also tolerant to etofenprox, which, like tau-fluvalinate, has a chemical structure of extended length relative to other pyrethroids. Interestingly voltage-gated sodium channels from German cockroach (Blattella germanica), D. melanogaster, and the yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti) were more sensitive to tau-fluvalinate and etofenprox than the BiNav1–1 channel, suggesting that sequences specific to BiNav1–1 may be responsible for its lower affinity for these insecticides. Alignments of the amino acid sequences of sodium channels from 11 bee species and 47 non-bee insect species identified three residues (T841 in domain IIS2, V926 in IIS5, and F1525 in IIIS6), which were conserved in sodium channel sequences of the analysed bee species, but not in the other species. Computational modelling of sodium channel three-dimensional structure and insecticide docking analyses identified four additional amino acid residues (P1007 and N1017 in IIS6, and V1528 and S1535 in IIIS6) as potential candidates for a role in tau-fluvalinate tolerance. Site-directed mutagenesis and functional analyses confirmed that these seven sites contribute to the tolerance of the bumblebee sodium channel to tau-fluvalinate versus other ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND
Widespread application of controlled-release pesticide delivery systems is a feasible and effective method to improve the utilization efficiency of pesticides. However, owing to the high cost and complicated preparation technologies of controlled-release pesticide delivery systems, their applications in agricultural production have been seriously hindered.

RESULTS
This study aimed to construct inexpensive photothermally controlled-release pesticide delivery systems using chitosan (CS) and sodium lignosulfonate (LS) as the wall materials, and a coordination assembly strategy of LS with transition metal ions to encapsulate a model pesticide, avermectin (AVM). The resulting complex or nanoparticle photothermal layers in these systems effectively achieved photothermal conversions, and replaced the use of common photothermal agents. In the prepared pesticide-delivery systems, two systems had remarkable photothermal conversion performance and photothermal stabilities with a photothermal conversion efficiency (?) of 24.03% and 28.82%, respectively, under 808?nm, 2?W near-infrared irradiation. The slow-release and ultraviolet-shielding performance of these two systems were markedly enhanced compared with other formulations. The insecticidal activities of these two systems against Plutella xylostella under irradiation with light-emitting diode (LED)-simulated sunlight were also enhanced by 5.20- and 5.06-fold, respectively, compared with that without irradiation of LED-simulated sunlight.

CONCLUSION
Because of their convenient preparations, inexpensive and renewable raw materials, and excellent photothermally controlled-release performance, these on-demand pesticide delivery systems might have significant potential in improving the utilization efficiency of pesticides in modern agriculture. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.

INTRODUCTION
Pesticides play vital roles in agriculture, and common pesticide formulations usually consist of emulsifiable concentrate, microemulsion, suspension concentrate, powder and granules among others. It is well known that common pesticide formulations can be easily degraded by photolysis, oxidation, hydrolysis and enzymolysis, and this results in the utilization efficiency of common pesticide formulations being extremely low, with fewer than 10% of pesticide active ingredients finally reaching the target organisms.1-3 It is worth noting that this low utilization efficiency has resulted in the abuse of pesticides, which has caused serious environmental pollution.4 In recent years, microencapsulation technology was adopted to encapsulate pesticide active ingredients in micro–nano capsule systems and protect them from the effects of surrounding environmental factors, hence effectively improving the utilization efficiency of pesticides.5, 6 Currently, controlled-release microcapsule pesticides have received extensive attention because the release of pesticide active ingredients can be effectively regulated by external stimuli-responsive conditions such as pH,7 temperature,8 magnetism,9 microbe,10 near-infrared (NIR),11 ultraviolet (UV) light12 and enzymes.13 Recently, a few photothermally controlled-release microcapsule pesticide-delivery systems have been reported.14 Under irradiation with NIR light or light-emitting diode (LED)-simulated sunlight, these systems could effectively convert the harvested light into heat energy via non-emissive deactivation, thus increasing the temperature of the pesticide systems and triggering the release of pesticide active ingredients.

During the construction of such photothermally controlled-release microcapsule pesticide-delivery systems, it is crucial to introduce agents with excellent photothermal performance, photothermal stability and lower cost into these systems. It is well known that common photothermal agents include organic polymers (such as polydopamine15), inorganic nanoparticles [such as silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)16, 17 and CuS18], carbon-based materials (such as carbon nanotubes,19 graphene,20 and carbon quantum dots21) and metal oxides,22 and are mainly used in cancer photothermal synergistic theragnostics,23, 24 cell treatments,25 and seawater desalination26 to establish photothermally activated systems. With regard to common photothermal agents, because of their high cost, poor degradability, and complex preparation technologies, they are unsuitable for the construction of photothermally controlled-release microcapsule pesticide-delivery systems, considering the vast amount used in agriculture production. To explore new construction methods and inexpensive photothermal agents for photothermally controlled-release microcapsule pesticide delivery-systems, we recently constructed a AVM@CS@TA–Fe system using the coordination assembly strategy of tannic acid (TA) with Fe3+; the formed TA–Fe complex photothermal layer had excellent photothermal performance under irradiation with NIR or LED-simulated sunlight, and the system achieved effective photothermally controlled-release of the model pesticide, avermectin (AVM).27

To further reduce the cost and improve the performance of photothermally controlled-release pesticide-delivery systems, in this study, a novel AVM@CS@LS–M delivery system was constructed with chitosan (CS) and sodium lignosulfonate (LS) as the wall materials, and Fe3+, Co3+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Ag+ as the chelating agents to encapsulate AVM. The reasons for this strategy are as follows. First, CS is a natural polysaccharide with low manufacturing costs and good biodegradability, thus it is an outstanding wall material.28-30 Second, LS is also a renewable natural biopolymer with good antioxidant and biodegradable capabilities and enhanced UV-shielding properties, and is a by-product of industrial pulping with an annual output of 50?000 tons and low cost.31-35 Third, LS has excellent coordination abilities to metal ions.36, 37 In the prepared AVM@CS@LS–M systems, AVM was first encapsulated with CS to form a microcapsule pesticide matrix using the emulsified cross-linking method, and an anionic LS layer was subsequently deposited on the surface of the microcapsule matrix by complex coacervation as a second encapsulated layer.38 On this premise, Fe3+, Co3+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Ag+ metal ions were added to coordinate with LS, constructing photothermal layers for these systems. The prepared AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe (1:1) and AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Ag (1:1) systems showed excellent photothermal controlled-release for AVM. The detailed fabrication processes and photothermally controlled-release of these systems are illustrated in Fig. 1.

Technical grade AVM (95%) was provided by He-bei Veyong BioChemical Co., Ltd (Hebei, China). CS (molecular weight?= 200?000, Degree of Deacetylation 90%) was purchased from Shandong Luhai LanSheng Biotechnology Co., Ltd (Shandong, China). LS was supplied by Shanghai Xushuo Biotechnology Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Phenvinyl phenyl polyoxyethylene ether (agricultural emulsifier no. 600) and polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) were purchased from Shandong Yusuo Chemical Technology Co., Ltd (Shandong, China). Iron (III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O), copper (II) chloride (CuCl2), silver nitrate (AgNO3), nickel (II) nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O), and cobalt (II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O) were from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). In addition, avermectin suspension concentrate (10%, AVM-SC) was purchased from Hebei Nongxin Biotechnology Science and Technology Co., Ltd (Hebei, China) and avermectin emulsifiable concentrate (1.8%, AVM EC) was from Henan Kaifeng Tianwei Biochemistry Co., Ltd (Henan, China). All other chemicals were of analytical grade, including sodium hydroxide, hexane, methanol and cyclohexanone. Deionized water was used for all reactions and treatment processes.

Preparation of the AVM@CS microcapsule matrix
First, 4.2?g of AVM technical grade was mixed with 8.4?g of cyclohexanone as the oil phase. Second, 1% (w/w) CS solution was prepared by dissolving CS in 2% (v/v) acetic acid aqueous solution at ambient temperature. The water phase was constituted by 25.4?g of CS solution 1% (w/w), 1.0?g of agricultural emulsifier no. 600 and 1.0?g of PEG 400. Finally, the water and oil phases were mixed in a three-necked flask at a stirring rate of 500?rpm. Further emulsification for 2?h was conducted to prepare the AVM@CS microcapsule matrix. The loading content (LC) and encapsulation efficiency (EE) were determined to be 9.60% and 96.80% (w/w) for the prepared AVM@CS microcapsule matrix, respectively.

Preparation of the AVM@CS@LS–M microcapsule delivery systems
A 10.0?g sample of AVM@CS microcapsule matrix was water-washed and centrifuged three times to remove the residual reactants. The resulting precipitate was dispersed in 15.0?mL of deionized water, 1.0?mol/L NaOH was used to regulate the pH of the micelle solution to 8.0, and 2.0?mL of LS solution (1.0?mol/L) was added dropwise to the mixture with a stirring rate of 500?rpm for 1?h. Then 4.0?mL of metal ion (Fe3+, Co3+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Ag+) aqueous solution (0.5?mol/L) was added to the mixture, the quality of the mixture was replenished to 40.0?g with deionized water, and the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–M (1:1) microcapsule suspensions were obtained by stirring the mixture at 500?rpm for 2?h. The LC and EE of the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe/Co/Ni/Cu/Ag (1:1) samples were determined to be 2.43% and 93.80%, 2.34% and 97.97%, 2.41% and 99.86%, 2.42% and 95.04%, and 2.40% and 98.90%, respectively. Other samples with different LS contents and complex ratios were prepared by adjusting the volumes of LS or the metal ion aqueous solution.

The morphology and structure of the prepared microcapsule samples were photographed and observed with an Olympus BX43 optical microscope (BX43; Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), SU8020 scanning electron microscope (SU8020; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan), Zeiss Libra 200 transmission electron microscope (Libra 200; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), VERTEX70 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (VERTEX70; Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany), and an energy-dispersive spectroscope (XFlash 6-30; Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). The TEM operated at a maximum accelerating voltage of 100?kV and the FTIR spectra were obtained using the KBr pellet method, scanning over the range of 400–4000?cm?1.

Loading content and encapsulation efficiency
In accordance with previous studies,39, 40 the LC and EE of the microcapsule samples were determined as follows. First, a certain amount of sample was weighed and placed into a 25.0 mL volumetric flask, 15.0?mL of methanol was added, the mixture was treated with ultrasound for 2?h, and the volume of the solution was fixed with methanol solution after cooling. Subsequently, the suspension was diluted ten times, and the concentration of AVM was measured at 245?nm using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2700), three parallel experiments were conducted. Second, a certain amount of sample was weighed and placed in a 3.0?mL centrifuge tube, the sample was extracted with hexane three times, and the extracting solution was diluted to 25.0?mL with methanol solution. The concentration of AVM was measured at 245?nm using a UV-visible spectrophotometer. The LC and EE of the prepared microcapsule samples were calculated according to the following equations:

Measurement of UV-shielding performance
The UV-shielding performance of the prepared microcapsule samples was measured as described in a previous study with a slight modifications.41 Briefly, microcapsule samples containing the same amount of AVM active ingredient, including the AVM, AVM-SC (10%, w/w), AVM@CS, AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe (1:1) and AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Ag (1:1), were weighed and placed in a methanol/water (20:80 v/v) solution in a photo-catalytic reactor (250?mL). The diluted suspension was then exposed to a UV lamp (254?nm, 28?W, and 30??W/cm2), continuously stirred and maintained at room temperature using recirculating water. At a certain point, 1.0?mL of suspension was extracted and placed in a 10.0?mL volumetric flask, an appropriate amount of methanol was added, and the suspension was then ultrasonically disrupted for 2?h and subsequently diluted to 10.0?mL. The residual amount of AVM in the above-mentioned samples was monitored by a UV-visible spectrophotometer at 245?nm. Furthermore, 1.0?mL of fresh methanol/water (20:80 v/v) solution was added after withdrawing each sample to replenish the volume in the system.

Measurement of release performance
Cumulative release profiles for the prepared microcapsule samples were measured using the dialysis assay.42 Samples containing the same amount of AVM active ingredient, including AVM, AVM-SC (10%, w/w), AVM@CS, AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe (1:1) and AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Ag (1:1) were weighed and transferred to dialysis bags with an intercepted molecular weight of 3000. The dialysis bags were sealed and immersed in brown reagent vials containing 400?mL of a methanol/water (3:2 v/v) solution. The reagent vials were placed on a shaker and shaken at 125 rpm at room temperature. At specific time intervals, 2.0?mL of the release medium outside the dialysis bags was withdrawn and analyzed by UV-visible spectrophotometry to determine the concentration of AVM. Furthermore, 2.0?mL of fresh release medium was added to replenish the volume in these systems. The effects of pH and temperature on the release performance of the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe (1:1) and AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Ag (1:1) systems were also investigated in detail.

Measurement of photothermal performance
The light absorption properties of aqueous dispersion solutions of the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe and AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Ag (1:1) systems were studied using UV-visible spectrophotometry. The photothermal performances of the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe/Co/Ni/Cu/Ag (1:1) microcapsule systems were compared with the AVM@CS microcapsule matrix and the blank H2O sample. The photothermal performances of the AVM@CS@LS–Fe systems with different LS content (2.70%, 1.35% and 0.68%) and complex ratios (4:1, 2:1, 1:1 and 1:2) were also studied. To evaluate the photothermal conversion efficiency and photothermal stabilities of the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe and AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Ag (1:1) systems, samples were irradiated using an NIR laser (808?nm, 2?W/cm2) for 20?min, and the laser was then turned off for 30?min. The change in the solution temperature was measured using a thermocouple thermometer. Subsequently, the implementation of laser ‘turn-on’ and ‘turn-off’ cycles was repeated five times to evaluate the photothermal stability of these systems. The photothermal conversion efficiency (?) was calculated using Eqns (3-6) as follows:43, 44

Measurement of insecticidal activity
Insecticidal activity experiments were carried out using the leaf-dipping method.45, 46 Insecticidal solutions of AVM, AVM EC, AVM@CS, and AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe or Ag (1:1) samples at a series of concentrations were prepared using deionized water. Fresh cabbage leaves (3?cm in diameter) were cut and dipped into these insecticide solutions for 30?min. Leaf discs dipped in deionized water served as controls. These leaf discs were dried at room temperature for ~2?h and placed in a glass Petri dish (90?mm?×?20?mm). Healthy and almost uniform sized Plutella xylostella larvae (second stage) were selected and allowed to feed in an oven without light irradiation at 25?°C or under irradiation with an LED light (SJZXZH001, 110 W) with illuminance of ~22?000 Lux on the treated leaf discs for 24?h. Larvae that showed no sign of movement when stimulated with a toothpick were considered dead. Three replicates were used for each concentration to ensure the accuracy of the tests. The toxicity regression equation was obtained, and median lethal concentration (LC50) values were calculated using log-probit analysis.47, 48 The revision mortality was calculated using Eqns (7) and (8) as follows:

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Characterization
The morphologies of the AVM@CS microcapsule matrix, AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe and Ag (1:1) microcapsule samples were investigated by OM, SEM and TEM. As shown in Fig. 2(a–c), there was no obvious agglomeration in these samples, all the microcapsules had a regular spherical shape and non-uniform size, and the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe (1:1) microcapsule sample had a relatively rougher surface than the AVM@CS microcapsule matrix. Notably, a large number of dense pores and tiny nanoparticles were observed on the surface of the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Ag (1:1) sample. The TEM images in Fig. 1(e) also indicated that the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Ag (1:1) system had a large number of nanoparticles attached to the microcapsule matrix. Figure 1(d) shows the uniform composition on the surface of the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe (1:1) microcapsule sample. According to previous reports,49-52 LS not only coordinated with Fe3+, Co3+, Ni2+, and Cu2+ ions, but also reduced the Ag+ to AgNPs. In the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe (1:1) system, the LS–Fe complex photothermal layer was formed on the surface of the microcapsule, whereas the AgNPs photothermal layer formed on the surface of the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Ag (1:1) microcapsule system.

As seen in Fig. 3(a,b), SEM and EDS were used to verify the composition of these samples. Their elemental mapping images revealed the presence of carbon, oxygen, iron, sulfur, and sodium elements in the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe (1:1) system with weight percentages of 58.9%, 34.9%, 4.5%, 0.9% and 0.7%, respectively. The weight percentages of carbon, oxygen, silver, sulfur, and sodium elements in the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Ag (1:1) system were 54.0%, 30.6%, 13.7%, 1.1% and 0.7%, respectively.

To identify the functional groups in the samples, the FTIR spectra of the AVM, CS, LS, AVM@CS, AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe (1:1) and AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Ag (1:1) microcapsule samples were measured. As shown in Fig. 4, for AVM, the characteristic absorption peak of C?O appeared at 1728.49?cm?1, and the characteristic absorption peak at 2968.63?cm?1 was attributed to the CH3 stretching vibration.53 For CS, the spectra showed the characteristic absorption peaks at 1655.10 and 1599.76?cm?1, respectively, which corresponded to the first and second stretching vibration bonds of amide groups.54 For LS, the absorption peaks at 1602.00, 1113.84, and 1039.51?cm?1 revealed the presence of the aromatic skeletal vibration, C?O?C stretching vibration in the methoxy group and S?O stretching vibration of SO3 groups.55 In the spectra of AVM@CS, AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe (1:1) and AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Ag (1:1) microcapsule samples, the characteristic C?O and CH3 stretching vibration peaks of AVM appeared with slight shifts, indicating that the AVM was not changed after encapsulation with CS, LS, and coordination assembly with Fe3+ and Ag+ ions. The aromatic skeletal vibration, C?O?C stretching vibration, and S?O stretching vibration of LS were also observed in the spectra of the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe (1:1) and AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Ag (1:1) systems with slight shifts, indicating the successful deposition of the LS layers on the surface of these two microcapsules.

UV-shielding performance
It is well known that LS is frequently used as a UV-shielding agent,56, 57 and this inspired us to used LS as an inexpensive wall material to construct microcapsule pesticide-delivery systems with excellent UV-shielding performance. The UV-shielding performances of the AVM, AVM-SC, AVM@CS, AVM@CS@LS–Fe, and AVM@CS@LS–Ag systems were investigated under irradiation with a UV lamp (254?nm, 28?W, and 30??W?cm?2) for 800?min. Figure 5(a) shows that the photolysis rate of the AVM, AVM-SC and AVM@CS samples reached 97.66%, 92.82%, and 93.50%, respectively, after 800?min of UV irradiation. When AVM was encapsulated in the AVM@CS@LS–Fe (1:1) systems, photolysis rates of 50.50%, 71.25%, and 75.18% were obtained corresponding to 2.70%, 1.35%, and 0.68% of LS content in the systems. These results revealed that the LS–Fe complex layer deposited on the surface of microcapsules had excellent UV-shielding performance, and the optimum proportion was 2.70% of LS content and a 1:1 complex ratio with iron ions. Figure 5(b) shows that the photolysis rates of AVM in the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Ag systems were 49.39%, 47.44% and 47.06%, respectively, corresponding to 2:1, 1:1, and 2:3 complex ratios of the LS with silver ions. These results demonstrated that the LS content is an essential factor in the UV-shielding performances of these systems, and a change in the complex ratio of LS with Ag+ ions had no significant influence on the UV-shielding performance of these systems.

Photothermal performance
First, the photothermal performances of the aqueous dispersion solutions of the AVM, AVM@CS, AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe/Co/Ni/Cu/Ag (1:1) systems at a concentration of 2.4?mg/mL, and the blank water sample were investigated under NIR laser irradiation of 808?nm for 1000?s. As shown in Fig. 6(d), the rise in temperature of the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe/Co/Ni/Cu/Ag (1:1) samples was 38.9, 24.8, 22.7, 30.0, and 48.1?°C, respectively, and the rise in temperature in the blank water sample, AVM, and the AVM@CS was 8.3, 10.3, and 8.0?°C, respectively. These results revealed that the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Ag and Fe systems had excellent photothermal performance under NIR laser irradiation, which resulted in a marked increase in temperature. Simultaneously, Fig. 6(a,g) shows that the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe (1:1) and AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Ag (1:1) systems had broad absorbance from the visible to the NIR region. Furthermore, the photothermal performances of the AVM@CS@LS–Fe systems with different LS contents and complex metal ratios were studied in detail. Figure 6(c) shows that the AVM@CS@LS–Fe (1:1) systems with 2.70%, 1.35% and 0.68% of LS content had a rise in temperature of 38.9, 30.7 and 25.1?°C, respectively, after NIR laser irradiation at 808?nm for 1000?s, and these results revealed that 2.70% of LS content in the AVM@CS@LS–Fe (1:1) systems resulted in a higher rise in temperature. As shown in Fig. 6(b), the rise in temperature of the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe systems with 4:1, 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2 complex ratios of LS with iron ions was 33.5, 37.7, 38.9, and 30.9°C, respectively. Of these, the 1:1 complex ratio had the best photothermal performance for the prepared AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe systems.

In the photothermal experiments, the time constant ?s was calculated by applying the linear time-dependent data collected during natural cooling. As shown in Fig. 6(e), when the sample was irradiated with an 808 nm laser for 1000?s, the increase in temperature of the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe (1:1) system was 38.9?°C, and the time constant ?s was determined to be 334.4143?s. The Tmax,sample, Tmax,solvent, I, and A808 values of the system were 62.3?°C, 36.0?°C, 5.7?W/cm2, and 0.119 Abs, respectively. The mD and cD are the mass (1.0?g) and heat capacity (4.2?J/g) of the deionized water used as the solvent, ? is the dimensionless driving force temperature. The driving force temperature Tsurr was 25.0?°C, and T was the temperature of the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe (1:1) system solution at a constant cooling time (t). The photothermal conversion efficiency ? of the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe (1:1) system was 24.03%, as calculated using Eqn (3). In addition, photothermal stability of the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe (1:1) system was explored by continuous laser irradiation every 50?min over five on/off cycles. As shown in Fig. 6(f), the photothermal performance of the system was well maintained after five continuous laser-on/laser-off cycles, and no significant change in the temperature was observed. These results demonstrated that the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe (1:1) system had excellent photothermal stability. For the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Ag (1:1) system, similar experimental results were found using the same procedures, the photothermal conversion efficiency ? of the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Ag (1:1) system was determined to be 28.82%, and the increase in temperature of the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Ag (1:1) system reached 48.1°C. The AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Ag (1:1) system also had excellent photothermal stability after five continuous laser-on/laser-off cycles, as shown in Fig. 6(i).

Effects of pH and temperature on controlled-release performance
As shown in Fig. 7(a), the cumulative released amount of AVM in the AVM technical grade, AVM-SC, AVM@CS, AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe (1:1) and AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Ag (1:1) systems was 98.93%, 96.06%, 86.69%, 69.14% and 82.08%, respectively, after 130?h of release in a methanol/water (3/2 v/v) solution at pH 7.0 and 25°C. In addition, the AVM technical grade and AVM-SC formulations showed an obvious burst release phenomenon at their initial release stages, and had higher final cumulative release rates after 130?h of treatment. The release performance of the AVM@CS sample was slightly improved by encapsulating with only CS wall material. Notably, no obvious burst release phenomenon was found in the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Ag (1:1) system, when it was encapsulated with CS, LS, and AgNPs photothermal layers. In addition, the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe (1:1) system showed an excellent slow-release performance after further encapsulation with the LS–Fe complex photothermal layers. Furthermore, the effects of temperature and pH values on the controlled-release performance of AVM in these two systems were investigated in detail. Figure 7(b,d) show that higher temperature resulted in a higher AVM cumulative release rate and the burst release phenomenon at the initial release stages, suggesting that the release of AVM in these systems could effectively be regulated by the change in external environmental temperature. Additionally, Fig. 7(c,e) reveal that the release of AVM in these systems was sensitive to pH values. A pH value of five showed a faster release than pH 7 and 9, respectively, and this could be attributed to hydrolysis of the LS–Fe complex photothermal layers along with the intramolecular electrostatic repulsion of the sulfonate groups in LS under acidic conditions.58

The release kinetics of the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe (1:1) and AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Ag (1:1) systems were studied to further clarify the sustained release mechanisms of these systems. Zero-order, first-order, Higuchi, and Korsmeyer–Peppas equations were used to fit the slow-release curve of the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe (1:1) and AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Ag (1:1) systems. The Korsmeyer–Peppas model achieved the best results, which are shown in Fig. 8(a,b), the fitting equation was Mt/M??=?6.8114 t0.4825 and Mt/M??=?8.0788t0.4748, with n values of 0.4825 and 0.4748, respectively. The n values were in the range of 0.43?<?n?<?0.85, showing that the release of AVM in these two systems were determined by a diffusion of the encapsuled AVM and corrosion of the wall materials.59

Insecticidal activity analysis
The second instar larvae of P. xylostella was used as a model insect to evaluate the insecticidal activity of the AVM technical grade, AVM EC, AVM@CS, AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe (1:1) and AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Ag (1:1) samples. Five test concentrations were set as 8.0, 16.0, 32.0, 48.0, and 96.0?mg/L, respectively. LC50 is a basic parameter for evaluating the effect of an insecticidal solution.60 As presented in Table 1, with or without the irradiation of LED-simulated sunlight (SJZXZH001, 110 W) with an illuminance of 22?000 Lux, the LC50 values and toxicity regression equations were obtained to assess the photothermal controlled-release effects of these AVM formulations against P. xylostella. Without the irradiation of LED-simulated sunlight, the prepared AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe (1:1) and AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Ag (1:1) systems showed higher LC50 values of 241.77 and 189.48 mg/L, respectively, than that of the AVM technical grade, AVM EC, and AVM@CS formulations, and this was attributed to the compact encapsulation of AVM in these two systems, which resulted in slower release of AVM at room temperature. Notably, all the tested samples had a reduction in LC50 values, especially the AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Fe (1:1) and AVM@CS@2.7%LS–Ag (1:1) systems which had a 5.20 and 5.06-fold reduction in LC50 values, respectively, after 24?h of irradiation with LED-simulated sunlight.

"Abstract
The escalating use of pesticides in agriculture for enhanced crop productivity threatens aquatic ecosystems, jeopardizing environmental integrity and human well-being. Pesticides infiltrate water bodies through runoff, chemical spills, and leachate, adversely affecting algae, vital primary producers in marine ecosystems. The repercussions cascade through higher trophic levels, underscoring the need for a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between pesticides, algae, and the broader ecosystem. Algae, susceptible to pesticides via spillage, runoff, and drift, experience disruptions in community structure and function, with certain species metabolizing and bioaccumulating these contaminants. The toxicological mechanisms vary based on the specific pesticide and algal species involved, particularly evident in herbicides' interference with photosynthetic activity in algae. Despite advancements, gaps persist in comprehending the precise toxic effects and mechanisms affecting algae and non-target species. This review consolidates information on the exposure and toxicity of diverse pesticides and herbicides to aquatic algae, elucidating underlying mechanisms. An emphasis is placed on the complex interactions between pesticides/herbicides, nutrient content, and their toxic effects on algae and microbial species. The variability in the harmful impact of a single pesticide across different algae species underscores the necessity for further research. A holistic approach considering these interactions is imperative to enhance predictions of pesticide effects in marine ecosystems. Continued research in this realm is crucial for a nuanced understanding of the repercussions of pesticides and herbicides on aquatic ecosystems, mainly algae.

1. Introduction
The increasing usage of pesticides and herbicides in contemporary agriculture has raised serious concerns because of the possible harm they may cause to aquatic environments. These chemicals severely threaten the fragile balance of marine environments because they enter aquatic bodies through runoff, chemical spills, and leachate (Rajak et al., 2023). Because they are crucial primary producers in aquatic ecosystems, algae are especially vulnerable to the negative impacts of pesticides, and their deteriorated health can have a domino effect on higher trophic levels. This thorough analysis provides insight into the complex interactions between algal communities and pesticides/herbicides and the various ecological effects (Bastviken et al., 2023). When algae are subjected to pesticides through several channels, like spills, runoff, and drift, their community structure and functioning functions are disturbed. Certain species are affected because they metabolize these chemical pollutants and accumulate them in their bodies, which intensifies their effects on the ecosystem as a whole (Dhanker et al., 2023). The toxicological mechanisms display significant heterogeneity contingent on the particular chemical and algae species. Interestingly, herbicides are potent inhibitors of algae photosynthetic activity, complicating our understanding of their ecological effects (Kumar et al., 2023). Critical gaps still need to be in our understanding of the harmful effects and mechanisms governing the interaction between pesticides and algae, as well as the unintentional consequences they have on non-target species, despite substantial advancements in research. To shed light on the underlying mechanisms at work, this study aims to compile and evaluate the body of research currently available regarding the exposure to and toxicity of a wide variety of pesticides and herbicides to aquatic algae (Thanigaivel et al., 2024). The complex interactions between nutrient content, pesticides, and herbicides and their combined effects on algae and related microbial species will be given particular attention (Sarker et al., 2024). The observed variation in a single pesticide's detrimental effects amongst different species of algae highlights the need for additional research to develop a more comprehensive knowledge. This review seeks to improve predictions about pesticide impacts in marine ecosystems by taking a comprehensive approach and considering these complex interactions. Understanding how these interactions interact is essential for making well-informed decisions and creating sustainable farming methods that lessen the unexpected effects of pesticide use (Barathi et al., 2024). This study highlights the critical need for more research to improve our understanding of the far-reaching effects of pesticides and herbicides on aquatic ecosystems, mainly algae, as we delve into the complex interactions between pesticides, algae, and the larger aquatic ecosystem. A more comprehensive approach is needed to address the changing issues in aquatic ecosystems as we navigate the intricacies of pesticide and herbicide impacts on algal communities (Wahab et al., 2023). The need for sustainable and environmentally conscious techniques is urgent since the growing demand for food production is driving the use of pesticides. Predicting the general health and resilience of aquatic ecosystems requires understanding the indirect effects on non-target species, such as fish, invertebrates, and microbial communities. Moreover, particular consideration should be given to how environmental variables like temperature, pH, and nutrient levels affect how pesticides and algae communities interact. Investigating these interactions in various ecological conditions can reveal information on how adaptable and susceptible algae species are to pesticide exposure (Machuca-Sepúlveda et al., 2023). The socioeconomic aspects of pesticide use also need to be taken into account A sophisticated strategy is needed to balance the requirement for greater agricultural productivity and the protection of aquatic ecosystems. Sustainable food production while reducing environmental impact requires the integration of ecological ideas into agricultural policies and practices (Agathokleous et al., 2023).

This extension stimulates more study and multidisciplinary cooperation amongst toxicologists, ecologists, agronomists, and legislators. To close knowledge gaps, a thorough grasp of the direct consequences of pesticides must be paired with an investigation of the more extensive ecological, environmental, and socioeconomic conditions. Our understanding of the interdependence of several elements affecting pesticide effects on algal communities opens the door to proactive conservation efforts and well-informed decision-making. Navigating the complex terrain of pesticide usage in agriculture and its consequences for the delicate balance of aquatic ecosystems requires ongoing research and a comprehensive approach.

2. Physico-chemical attributes of pesticides
Pesticides exhibit various physical and chemical properties that affect how they behave in the environment to manage pests and improve agricultural yields. A crucial component that affects mobility and possible leaching into groundwater or surface water discharge is pesticide solubility, which differs among them (Das et al., 2022). Highly volatile pesticides are transported through the atmosphere and contribute to air pollution due to their volatility, which reflects vaporization tendencies. The affinity of a pesticide for organic substances is shown by the Octanol-Water Partition Coefficient (Kow), which affects the potential for bioaccumulation in lipid-rich tissues and sediments (Concha-Graña et al., 2022). A pesticide's persistence—how long it remains in the environment before decomposing—is a significant factor in its long-term ecological hazards. The fate and toxicity of substances in the environment are further shaped by degradation routes such as photolysis, hydrolysis, and microbial degradation (Halevas et al., 2022). Different pesticide classes have different chemical structures, which define their modes of action and affect how they interact with both target and non-target organisms. Mobility is impacted by adsorption to soil particles, and high adsorption coefficients decrease leaching concerns. pH sensitivity influences the preferences, pesticide transformations, and bioavailability in various environments. Water repellence, or hydrophobicity, affects an organism's distribution in aquatic environments and interactions with other aquatic creatures (Hrynko et al., 2023). The composition, which includes carriers and adjuvants, influences stability and physical characteristics. A comprehensive comprehension of these characteristics is essential for evaluating the influence on the environment, creating efficient management plans, and advocating for environmentally friendly farming methods that reduce damage to ecosystems (Teklu et al., 2023). A thorough understanding of pesticide behavior is made possible by ongoing study in this area, which makes it easier to create ecologically friendly pest management plans. Table 1 summarized pesticide properties and highlighted sediment studies in background agricultural soils.

2.1. Environmental half-lives and mobility of pesticides/herbicides
The half-life describes how long the time required for an identified quantity of pesticide or herbicide to be decreased in half. This happens when it degrades in the ecosystem. A pesticide will typically degrade to 50 % of its original concentration following 1 half-life. Following 2 half-lives, about 25 % remain (Fantke et al., 2014). Following 3 half-lives, approximately 12 % will continue to be present. This proceeds till the quantity left are almost zero. According to the surrounding circumstances, every pesticide or herbicide might exhibit multiple half-lives (Zaller, 2020). For instance, permethrin degrades at different rates in vegetation, water, soil, as well as dwellings. Permethrin's half-life in soil is approximately 40 days, with a range of 11–112 days. Permethrin has a half-life that ranges from 19 to 27 h in water. If this adheres to debris, it may persist for years. Permethrin's half-life on surfaces of plants varies between 1 and 3 weeks based on the sort of plant. Permethrin's half-life can vary significantly indoors. It is anticipated that it will last more than 20 days, if not longer (Elser et al., 2022).

A half-life can determine the degree to which or not a herbicide or pesticide accumulates in the soil and water. Pesticide lifespans can be divided into three groups for determining persistence (Caldas, 2019). They are classified as low (>16 days half-life), intermediate (16–59 days), as well as high (<60 days). Pesticides having a shorter half-life accumulate less since they're unable to remain in their surroundings. Pesticides having more prolonged half-lives, on the other hand, are prone to accumulate over time. This raises the possibility of polluting adjacent groundwater, surface water, vegetation, as well as animals (Tadeo et al., 2019). Nevertheless, pesticides with extremely brief half-life can have negative consequences. A single use of a pesticide that has a few-hour half-life is unlikely to be highly efficient for a while later. It's so because the product might have degraded to almost zero levels after just a few days. This kind of substance would most likely need to be administered repeatedly during those weeks. This may raise the potential hazards of exposure to humans, and non-target livestock, including plants (Tudi et al., 2021). The long-term stability of pyrazosulfuron-ethyl was examined under three humidity conditions. Pyrazosulfuron-ethyl retention in sediments follows first-order exponential breakdown kinetics, mostly affected by soil organic matter as well as moisture levels. The half-lives of pyrazosulfuronethyl in soil varied between 42.9 and 85.5 days (Sondhia, 2019). Chlorsulfuron degrades rapidly in low-pH soil and has a higher GR50 value compared to high-pH soil (Sondhia, 2019).

Metsulfuron-methyl half-life ranged from 6.3 to 17.5 days. Nevertheless, leftovers of metsulfuron-methyl paddy topsoil at thirty days were 0.008–0.016 µg g?1 with a rate of application of 2–8 g/ha(Paul et al., 2009). At harvesting, residue levels in soil, grains of rice, as well as straw were less than 0.001 µg g?1. Herbicide metabolites in agricultural products that exceed the permissible limit can be harmful to humans and animals. The final destination of herbicides in the soil is determined by a variety of steps, including volatilization, microbe degradation, leaching, chemical processes, photodecomposition, and runoff (Islam et al., 2018a).

3. Understanding the interplay between pesticides, algae, and ecosystems
Pesticides are essential for increasing agricultural yields but also quite dangerous for aquatic environments. Therefore, understanding how they interact with algae and larger ecosystems is essential. This section explores the nuanced interactions between these components, illuminating complicated mechanisms and their ecological implications (Vijayaraj et al., 2022). Herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides are among the pesticides used in agriculture to suppress pests, guarantee food security, and increase yields. Utilized in a variety of ways, including spraying and soil integration, these compounds are now widely used in contemporary agricultural techniques (Polazzo et al., 2022).

Pesticides can enter water bodies through many different routes. Pesticides from fields are carried by runoff from irrigation or rain, chemical spills during handling lead to direct contamination, and leaching permits pesticides to seep into the soil and eventually reach groundwater, contaminating aquatic environments(Ma et al., 2022). Algae are essential primary producers in aquatic habitats that contribute significantly to the food chain. Algal communities offer essential insights into the health of ecosystems because they are sensitive indicators of environmental changes. Algal species are essential players in cycling nutrients and energy transmission due to their diversity and ecological roles. Pesticide exposure can affect algal communities through direct contact with polluted water, indirect contact through contaminated prey, and interruption of photosynthesis, especially from herbicides (Peña et al., 2023). Algal growth, reproduction, and general community dynamics may be impacted by such exposure. Exposure to pesticides can cause changes in the dominance of algae species, which can impact higher trophic levels and have a domino effect on the aquatic food web. It is possible for biodiversity to disappear, reducing ecosystem stability and resistance to environmental alterations (Wu et al., 2022). Different algae may metabolize and detoxify poisons in different ways, affecting their susceptibility. Pesticides may bioaccumulate in algal tissues, which could result in biomagnification as the toxins climb the food chain and endanger higher trophic levels. Herbicides intended to attack the photosynthetic machinery disrupt algae's ability to produce chlorophyll and move electrons. The intricacy of these relationships is highlighted by the varied responses that various algae species exhibit to photosynthetic interference caused by herbicides (Feng et al., 2023).

4. Vulnerability of algal communities to pesticide exposure
As essential primary producers in marine environments, algal communities are particularly vulnerable to pesticide exposure. Pesticides seep into water bodies from urban areas, industrial operations, and agricultural runoff, exposing algal communities to direct contact with pesticide-contaminated waters (Vormeier et al., 2023). This exposure causes rapid physiological stress that impairs photosynthesis growth rates and, in extreme situations, results in death. Through trophic interactions, herbivores that eat pesticide-contaminated algae serve as conduits, allowing poisons to move up the food chain and causing indirect exposure (López-Valcárcel et al., 2023). Because of the bioaccumulation that this process causes, higher trophic levels—fish and marine mammals—and algae are at risk. Herbicides, in particular, target algae's photosynthetic apparatus, preventing the formation of chlorophyll and electron transport (Cao et al., 2023). Fundamental physiological functions like growth and metabolism are impacted by this interference, which has a domino effect on the structure and function of the community as a whole. Different algal species are more or less susceptible to pesticides, which can cause changes in variety and even biodiversity loss (Legrand et al., 2022). The potential to exacerbate eutrophication is one of the ecosystem-level repercussions and cascade impacts on the marine environment. A comprehensive strategy that considers the properties of pesticides, the diversity of algal communities, and the dynamics of the larger marine ecosystem is essential to reducing these vulnerabilities (Kock et al., 2022). With this knowledge, specific conservation strategies may be developed to protect algae's vital role in preserving the health of the marine ecosystem. As primary producers essential to marine ecosystems, algal communities are incredibly vulnerable to pesticide exposure. The complex interactions between pesticides and these vital creatures show difficulties requiring further investigation into their ecological consequences (Truchy et al., 2022). Algal communities directly exposed to pesticide-contaminated waters—from many sources, including urban areas, industrial operations, and agricultural runoff—experience an instant physiological stressor. Changes in growth rates, problems with photosynthesis, and, in severe situations, higher rates of algal population death are some ways this stress presents itself (Voltz et al., 2022).

Furthermore, indirect exposure via trophic relationships adds another level of intricacy. Pesticide-contaminated algae, which serve as conduits to move toxins up the marine food chain, is consumed by herbivores. This causes bioaccumulation, which puts higher trophic levels—fish and marine mammals—at risk in addition to algae (Creusot et al., 2022). Beyond specific species, this bioaccumulation affects the biological balance of the marine ecosystem as a whole. Pesticides have particularly noticeable physiological effects on algal communities, especially in herbicides targeting the photosynthetic system. Essential functions like growth and metabolism are jeopardized when there are disruptions in the generation of chlorophyll and electron transportation (Ulrich et al., 2022). The general structure and function of algal communities are affected by these disruptions, which have a cascade influence on their composition and the dynamics of the marine ecosystem. A further layer of complexity is introduced by the realization that various algae species vary in susceptibility. Changes in algal diversity brought about by this variability may result in some species becoming more dominant than others, contributing to biodiversity loss. Such changes have cascade consequences on herbivores, detritivores, and predators, affecting the larger marine environment. The hazards at the ecological level include possible eutrophication aggravation and disturbances within the algal populations (Wang et al., 2024). Changes in nitrogen cycling by pesticides may raise nutrient availability, supporting algal blooms and lowering water quality. The general resilience and vitality of the marine ecosystem are thus put in jeopardy. A comprehensive strategy that considers the many properties of pesticides, the complex dynamics within algal populations, and the larger context of marine ecosystem dynamics is required to mitigate these vulnerabilities (MacKnight et al., 2022). This knowledge lays the groundwork for creating focused conservation plans that protect the vital function of algae in preserving the health and equilibrium of marine ecosystems.

5. Disruptions in community structure and function
One of the most critical aspects of the complex interactions within marine ecosystems is the disruptions that pesticide exposure causes to the structure and function of algal populations. The composition, variety, and ecological roles of algal communities are all impacted by these changes, which have far-reaching effects on the marine ecosystem (Harb and Chow, 2022). Exposure to pesticides frequently causes changes in the relative abundance of particular algae species in communities. There may be changes in species composition and abundance due to some proving hardier and others succumbing to the toxic effects (Rosenkranz et al., 2023). This change may impact the algal community's resilience and overall biodiversity. Some species may be more resistant to pesticides than others, which could result in overrepresenting these hardy species. These changes may impact the complex equilibrium of the marine environment. Algal communities' biomass and production can change due to pesticide exposure (Kakakhel et al., 2023). Diminished rates of growth, compromised photosynthesis, and disturbances in metabolic activities may lead to variations in the community's overall production. These changes may impact the marine ecosystem's energy transfer and nitrogen cycle (Chen et al., 2024). The loss of variety within communities can be partly attributed to the sensitivity of various algae species to pesticides. Algal communities' overall diversity may decrease as some species respond to pesticide exposure by growing or declining. This biodiversity loss may jeopardize the ecosystem's ability to adapt and remain stable. Higher trophic levels of the marine food chain are affected in a cascade manner by disturbances in the structure of the algal community (Novais et al., 2023). Changes in algal quantity and composition directly impact herbivores, detritivores, and predators. Changes in the quantity and quality of prey can impact the ecosystem, affecting the distribution and abundance of different marine species. Within algal populations, pesticide-induced disturbances can alter the cycle of nutrients. In marine ecosystems, nutrient availability, absorption, and assimilation variations can impact the cycling of vital elements (Zhao et al., 2020). The microbial and algal communities may be impacted by these imbalances caused by this changed nitrogen cycle. Algal communities exposed to pesticides may become more vulnerable to other environmental stressors, such as salinity, temperature, or variations in nutrition availability. These communities' diminished resilience may make adjusting to and recovering from various environmental difficulties more challenging (Wijewardene et al., 2021).

6. Metabolism and bioaccumulation of pesticides by algae
An essential part of algae's interaction with aquatic environments is their metabolism and bioaccumulation of pesticides, which affects the fate of these pollutants in marine ecosystems. Pesticides are absorbed, changed, and accumulated by algae in this complex process that has wide-ranging effects on the food chain (Avila et al., 2021). Algae from the water column can directly absorb pesticides; active transport or diffusion are two ways the toxins can enter the cells. The concentration of pesticides, the kind of algae, and the physicochemical characteristics of the pollutants all affect the absorption rate (Mustafa et al., 2021). Once within the algal cells, pesticides go through a series of metabolic changes. Algae can have enzyme systems that convert pesticides into less harmful forms or conjugate them for simpler excretion. Algae rely on metabolism as a vital defense mechanism to withstand the harmful effects of some pesticides. Pesticide concentrations in the algal biomass can rise above those in the surrounding water due to accumulation (Goh et al., 2023). The ongoing absorption and retention of pesticides by algae cells is the cause of this bioaccumulation. Then, as predators eat infected prey, the accumulated pesticides may be transported along the food web and undergo biomagnification (Asimakis et al., 2022). The ability of various algae species to metabolize and bioaccumulate chemicals varies. Pesticides may be effectively metabolized and excreted by certain animals, but slower metabolic processes may cause more significant amounts in other species. This variability influences the overall diversity of reactions within algal communities.

Pesticides collected by algae can move to higher trophic levels through trophic interactions. When pesticide-laden algae are consumed by zooplankton and other herbivores, the toxins may build up in their tissues (Meng et al., 2022). Pesticides increase the reach of organisms, such as fish and marine mammals, at higher trophic levels due to this trophic transfer, which increases their reach along the food chain. The environment significantly impacts how pesticides are metabolized and accumulate in algae (Quan et al., 2023). Various factors, including temperature, light intensity, availability of nutrients, and water chemistry, can influence the rate and degree of pesticide uptake and transformation within algal cells. Pesticides that have been digested or not may be released by algae back into the water, thus contaminating the aquatic ecosystem as a whole (Li et al., 2022a). Various factors, including algal growth, ambient conditions, and the metabolic pathways involved, impact the dynamic process of pesticide release from algae. Comprehending the processes of pesticide metabolism and bioaccumulation by algae is crucial to appreciate the possible hazards linked to pesticide exposure in marine environments (C et al., 2023). Fig. 1 shows the effects of algal bloom by combined toxicity.

7. Variability in effects on different algal species
Because different algae species have diverse physiologies, metabolic pathways, and susceptibilities to different toxicological processes, the impact of pesticides on those species can differ significantly. It is crucial to comprehend this variety to forecast how pesticides may affect various algae groups ecologically. Pesticides cause various algae species to react differently. Specific species might be more vulnerable to specific pollutants, while others might have built-in detoxification or toleration systems (Focardi et al., 2022). This sensitivity is frequently linked to the unique metabolic processes and defensive systems in every type of algae. It exhibits a variety of metabolic pathways that impact its capacity to break down and eliminate pollutants. Certain algae may have enzymes that may change or break down particular compounds, giving them a degree of resilience. The differences in reactions between algae species can be attributed partly to the variety of their metabolic pathways. Algal species differ in physiological traits such as cellular physiology, membrane permeability, and cell wall structure. These variations affect how pesticides are absorbed and accumulated and affect specific algae (Rajendran et al., 2022). For example, some herbicides that target cell membranes may not affect algae with more muscular cell walls. It displays a variety of growth rates, life cycles, and reproduction techniques (Mahesh et al., 2023). Pesticides can have varying effects on these factors, resulting in diverse reactions. Slower-growing species might have difficulties recovering from short-term pesticide exposure, whereas faster-growing species might be more resistant (Yaashikaa et al., 2022). Furthermore, it has specific dietary needs, and nutrient availability might affect its pesticide susceptibility. Aquatic environment nutrient levels may influence how pesticides affect the growth and metabolism of algae. Modifications in nutrient dynamics can impact the competitive relationships between various algae species (Valente et al., 2022). Over time, algae can adjust to environmental stressors, and certain species may create acclimation mechanisms in response to repeated pesticide exposure. Because of this plasticity, the long-term consequences on various algae species vary according to how well they can adapt to changing conditions (Steinhäuser et al., 2022). Interactions with other environmental conditions frequently impact the effects of pesticides on algal species. Variations in temperature, light intensity, pH, and nutrition availability can alter the effects of pesticides and cause reactions unique to individual species. It is found in intricate biological communities where interactions between various algae species may affect how they react to pesticides. A dynamic and context-dependent situation could arise from changes in the abundance and composition of one algal species, which could then have a domino effect on other algae species (Garg et al., 2023).

8. Herbicides' impact on photosynthetic activity in algae
One of the main ways that herbicides impair the physiological functions of these vital primary producers in aquatic environments is by having a substantial effect on the photosynthetic activity of algae. Depending on the type of herbicide, its concentration, and the individual algal species involved, the effects on photosynthesis can differ (Wang et al., 2022). Numerous herbicides, including diuron and atrazine, block Photosystem II (PSII), the first step in the photosynthetic electron transport chain. The first stages of photosynthesis, in which light energy is received and used to split water molecules, depend on PSII. When PSII is inhibited, electron flow is disrupted, preventing the formation of energy-rich molecules (Majewska et al., 2021). The pigment chlorophyll, necessary for absorbing light during photosynthesis, can be disrupted by herbicides. Herbicides reduce the overall efficiency of light absorption by algal cells, impeding the photosynthetic process by interfering with the manufacture of chlorophyll (Machado and Soares, 2021). The electron transport chain, a sequence of molecular processes essential for transforming light energy into chemical energy, may be interfered with by herbicides. The generation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which are necessary for driving photosynthetic activities, is jeopardized by this disturbance in the electron flow (Liu et al., 202",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abstract
Over the years, bioaccumulation of hazardous chemicals in the food chain has become a critical issue, resulting in numerous health risks. Environmental mitigation aims to clean up contaminated sites and eliminate hazardous materials from the air, water, or soil to restore the site to its original and safe condition. Pesticides constitute one of the most dangerous environmental pollutants which are generally used to increase crop production. Addressing the removal or treatment of pesticides has become pivotal in mitigating environmental threats. Diverse remediation methods are employed to protect the environment and public health. Graphene-based materials have emerged as promising candidates with exceptional properties, including excellent adsorption capacity due to their high surface area, strong hydrophilicity, and tunable properties. Owing to these properties, they have been attracting major research attention in the field of design and fabrication of materials for the mitigation of pesticides from the environment such as from contaminated food, water and other samples. Various physical, chemical and biological extraction techniques are adopted to remove pesticides. This review article provides an insight into the potential role of graphene-based materials in the environmental remediation of pesticides. We have focused on the removal of Organophosphates, Organochlorines, Carbamates and Pyrethroids present in water, fruit, vegetable and other samples, highlighting the urgent need for environmental remediation. While graphene-based materials hold potential for pesticide remediation, addressing challenges in scalable production, assessing long-term sustainability, and mitigating potential environmental impacts are critical steps for successful large-scale applications.

1. Introduction
As industrialization and human activities continue to grow, hazardous substances are being released into landfills, industries, and private properties, posing threats to the environment and human health. This has become a global concern, and new technologies are being explored to combat contamination in air, water, and soil. Environmental remediation refers to the process of the removal or treatment of pollutants or hazardous materials from soil, water and air or cleaning up contaminated environmental sites and restoring them to their original or acceptable state [1].

Environmental remediation is essential in restoring the natural environment by removing harmful pollutants from various sources, such as soil and water, to protect public health and the environment. These hazardous pollutants include insecticides, herbicides, heavy metals, oil spills, poisonous gases, industrial effluents, sewage, and organic compounds. However, pollutant capture and degradation can be difficult due to the complex mixture of compounds and low reactivity. Therefore, there is a need for ecologically friendly and sustainable materials and approaches in environmental remediation. Environmental remediation can be performed at various scales, from small contaminated sites to large-scale industrial sites, and it often requires the involvement of multidisciplinary teams of experts [2].

Pesticides are one of the major pollutants that can persist in the environment for a long time depending on factors such as their chemical properties, soil type, temperature, and rainfall [[3], [4], [5]]. These are chemical substances essential in improving crop yields. These are used to kill, repel, or control pests such as insects, rodents, fungus, and weeds [3]. The environmental fate of pesticides refers to their behavior in the environment, including their transformation, movement, metabolism, and degradation. Pesticides can undergo various environmental fate processes, including photolysis, hydrolysis, volatilization, leaching, and biodegradation and lead to their adverse effects in the food chain as shown in Fig. 1. While pesticides have been instrumental in enhancing food production and controlling disease vectors, their widespread use has led to environmental contamination that poses a serious threat to human health as well as the environment as a whole. Pesticides can enter the environment through various pathways, including agricultural runoff, atmospheric deposition, and direct application [6,7]. The environmental repercussions of pesticides, particularly their potential to pollute soil, water, air, and cropland, are of significant scientific concern. Therefore, its remediation involves the use of different strategies to mitigate the effects of pesticide contamination on the environment [8,9].

For the safeguard of the environment as well as public health, there are various environmental remediation techniques for pesticides, including physical, chemical, and biological [11,12]. The choice of remediation technique again relies on several factors like, type of pesticide as well as its concentration in the specific sample, nature of the contaminated medium [13]. However, the complex nature of pesticide captures and degradation, caused by the combination of different substances, their tendency to evaporate quickly, and low reactivity, makes it challenging to deal with them. As a result, there is an increasing demand for sustainable and environmentally friendly materials.

Graphene-based materials have shown promising potential toward the remediation of pesticides owing to their unique physicochemical properties. These properties include high surface area imparting extraordinary adsorption capacity, and strong reactivity [14,15]. Several studies have demonstrated that graphene-based materials possess adsorption capacity of usually higher than other materials, such as activated carbon, due to their extremely large surface area and numerous ?-bonds, which can get involved in several types of interactions with the pesticide molecules [16]. Moreover, these materials are known to exhibit excellent photocatalytic properties [17,18], which find great application in the degradation of several pesticides in water and soil. Under UV or visible light, these materials can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can break down the pesticide molecules into harmless products. In addition, graphene-based products have significantly good electrical conductivity and can be used as electrodes for the electrochemical degradation of pesticides. When a voltage is applied, the electrodes can generate ROS, breaking down the pesticide molecules. The graphene oxide membrane has excellent water permeability and can effectively remove pesticides from water through size exclusion, adsorption, and electrostatic repulsion [19,20].

This literature reported various physical, chemical, electrochemical and biological methods involved in pesticide remediation. Each method has advantages and disadvantages and can be used alone or in combination with other strategies for effective pesticide remediation. This review article makes a novel attempt to provide insight into the potential role of various graphene-based materials towards the environmental remediation from pesticides.

2. Types of pesticides and their harmful effects
Pesticides are chemicals that are used to repel or prevent or kill or control the growth of pests that harm crops, livestock, and human health. They are common in agriculture, homes, offices, gardens, and public health initiatives. Pesticides are categorized according to their use towards targets, chemical structure, and toxicity. Certain pesticides are dangerous to people and non-target creatures, while others are not. There are various ways of classifying the types of pesticides depending on a different basis of classification [21].

2.1. On the basis of their targets
Pesticides are classed based on the pest species which they are intended to repel or kill and are given unique names to reflect their actions. The pesticide category names are derived from the Latin word “cide” meaning killer and is named after the specific target pest [22]. The major types of pesticides falling in this category are listed below:

2.1.1. Insecticides
Insecticides are used to repel or kill insects that cause agricultural damage and disease transmission. They function by interfering with the neurological system, breathing system, or growth and development of insects. Organophosphates, organochlorines, carbamates and pyrethroids are some common insecticides. Organophosphates and carbamates decrease the function of cholinesterase, an enzyme that controls nerve impulse transmission, causing paralysis and death in insects. Pyrethroids replicate the actions of natural pesticides generated from chrysanthemum flowers, pyrethrins, by binding to sodium channels in insect nerve cells, inducing excitation and paralysis. Neonicotinoids paralyze and kill insects by binding to their nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Organochlorines, such as DDT, were once widely utilized but are now banned in many countries due to their persistence in the environment [8,23].

2.1.2. Herbicides
Herbicides are used to control weeds that compete with crops for nutrients, water, and sunlight. They work by inhibiting the activity of enzymes involved in plant growth and metabolism or disrupting the structure and function of plant cell membranes. Some common herbicides are glyphosate, 2, 4-D, atrazine, paraquat, and dicamba. Glyphosate inhibits the activity of EPSP synthase, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids, leading to the accumulation of toxic intermediates and the death of plants. 2, 4-D mimics the effects of auxin, a plant hormone that regulates growth and development, leading to abnormal growth and death of plants. Atrazine inhibits the activity of photosystem II, a complex of proteins involved in photosynthesis, leading to the production of ROS and the death of plants. Paraquat and dicamba disrupt the integrity of plant cell membranes, leading to the leakage of cellular contents and the death of plants [4,23].

2.1.3. Fungicides
Fungicides are used to prevent or control growth of fungi that cause diseases in crops, trees, and animals. They work by interfering with the metabolism or cell division of fungi or disrupting the integrity of fungal cell membranes. Some common fungicides are azoles, strobilurins, benzimidazoles, and copper-based compounds. Azoles inhibit the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes, leading to the disruption of membrane function and the death of fungi. Strobilurins is known for inhibition ofcomplex III activity in the transport chain of mitochondrial electron, that leads to the production of ROS and the death of fungi. Benzimidazoles inhibit the activity of tubulin, a protein involved in the formation of microtubules, leading to the disruption of cell division and death of fungi. Copper-based compounds disrupt the integrity of fungal cell membranes, leading to the leakage of cellular contents and the death of fungi [23].

2.1.4. Bactericides
Bactericides are used to prevent the growth of bacteria on crops, plants, and other surfaces. While bactericides effectively control bacterial infections, they can also harm the environment, human health, and non-target organisms. Bactericides can contaminate soil, water, and air, leading to environmental pollution. Bactericides can leave residues on crops that are consumed by humans and animals. These residues can be toxic and can be potential cause of cancer, congenital disabilities, and several neurological disorders. Bactericides can also harm various non-target species, like beneficial bacteria, birds, insects, and mammals, which may be important for soil health, pollination, pest control, and other ecosystem services. Exposure to bactericides can also be a reason for severe health problems in humans, such as respiratory problems, skin irritation, neurological disorders, etc. [23].

2.1.5. Rodenticides
Rodenticides are used to repel or inhibit rodents, such as mice and rats, that damage crops, structures, and public health. They work by disrupting the nervous system, respiratory system, or blood clotting of rodents, leading to internal bleeding and eventual death. However, rodenticides can also have harmful side effects on humans and other animals. These can also cause accidental ingestion if not used and stored properly [23].

2.2. On the basis of biodegradability
Biodegradability is the ability of pesticides to decompose naturally. It is a crucial characteristic that governs how they will behave and be distributed in the environment. Biodegradation refers to the breakdown of complex organic compounds into simple molecules, like, water, carbon dioxide, and other substances, by microorganisms. Biodegradation of pesticides can take place in different environmental settings, such as soil, water, or air, depending on their chemical features and surrounding conditions. Pesticides that are easily biodegradable can be broken down swiftly by microorganisms, while those that are resistant can persist in the environment for prolonged periods and accumulate in the food chain.

2.2.1. Biodegradable pesticides
Biodegradable pesticides refer to chemicals that can be decomposed into harmless substances by natural processes such as water, sunlight, and microorganisms. These pesticides are environmentally friendly because they do not stay in the environment and do not accumulate in the food chain. Compared to traditional pesticides, biodegradable pesticides are less harmful to non-target organisms like birds, bees, and other wildlife. Examples of biodegradable pesticides include neem oil, pyrethrins, and spinosad derived from plants or microorganisms. While biodegradable pesticides are generally considered safe for humans and the environment, incorrect use can still pose a risk to beneficial insects and other non-target organisms. Therefore, the environmental impact of pesticides is strongly influenced by their biodegradability [22,24].

2.2.2. Non-biodegradable pesticides
Pesticides that are not easily broken down by natural processes and can last for extended periods of time are known as non-biodegradable pesticides. Typically, these pesticides are synthetic compounds created to be stable and long-lasting to offer extended protection against pests. Examples of non-biodegradable pesticides include DDT and chlordane, which are organochlorines, as well as malathion and parathion, which are organophosphates. They are highly toxic to insects and other living beings and can also be dangerous to human health. They can accumulate in the environment and the food chain, leading to severe, long-term effects on ecosystems and human health.

Overall, use of pesticides has become a complex issue that involves balancing the need to control pests and protect crops with the need to minimize the environmental as well as human health effects of these chemicals. By understanding the different types of pesticides on the basis of biodegradability and other factors, we can make informed decisions about the most appropriate pest management strategies for different situations. We must also continue to develop and promote alternative pest management strategies that are environmentally sustainable and socially equitable.

2.3. On the basis of chemical composition
Pesticides may be chemical or biological compounds which can be derived from plant or plant products. The study of the classification of pesticides on the basis of their chemical composition is quite important as their chemical buildup decides the amount of toxic and harmful components present in a pesticide which can cause huge damage to our environment. There are several types of pesticides based on chemical composition as shown in Table 1, and they have different modes of action and toxicity levels. These include Organophosphates, Organochlorines, Carbamate, Pyrethroid and Pyrethrin which are shown in Fig. 2 [8,24,25].

Fig. 2. Examples of various pesticide types along with their chemical structures.

2.3.1. Organophosphates
Organophosphates (OP) pesticides with the general structure Odouble bondP(OR)3 and are basically esters derived from phosphoric acid; this is used as an insecticide, especially on fruits and vegetables. The chemical structure comprises of a central phosphate molecule attached to alkyl or aromatic substituents [26]. OPs are extensively used in various products such as in plasticizers, flame retardants, engine oil, etc. They are widely used in textile, electronic, agriculture and furniture industries because of their low cost of production and high compatibility with various polymers, but there are various harmful effects of OPs. Most of the OPs are neurotoxic and affect the nervous system due to inhibition of the function of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme in various nerve cells. Due to their potential for absorption by ingestion, inhalation, and cutaneous absorption, OPs are one of the most prevalent causes of poisoning in living things globally [27]. Prolonged OPs exposure can lead to memory loss, severe depression and impairment of embryonic development, thyroid hormones, and various ill-effects on the neurological systems of living organisms.

2.3.2. Organochlorines
Organochlorine pesticide (OCP) is a synthetic chemical pesticide which is very toxic, poisonous and persistent. OCPs were commonly used earlier as an effective mosquito killer, but now it is banned in many countries because of their ill impact on the health of living organisms and the environment OCPs belong to four structural classes: diphenyl aliphatics, cyclodienes, cyclohexanes, and polychloroterpenes. In OCPs, there is a very strong bond between carbon and chlorine which makes them soluble in fats and insoluble in water which further leaches the pesticide when it rains and causes bioaccumulation of toxic substances because of its persistent nature [28]. Along with bioaccumulation, exposure to OCPs for a longer duration can cause central nervous system depression, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other breathing problems.

2.3.3. Carbamates
Carbamate pesticides are basically carbamic acid-derived organic compounds that is derived from, which are usually obtained when one or more hydrogen atoms in carbamic acid are replaced by other organic moieties [29]. Carbamates can be synthesized by the alcoholysis of chloroformamides and ammonium carbamate can be prepared by the treatment of ammonia with carbon dioxide. Ammonium carbamate is used as an intermediate for the synthesis of urea. Carbamates are also used as wood and paint preservatives and in cosmetics. Still, the Carbamate pesticide is quite harmful and dangerous because it is very poisonous and deactivates the AChE enzyme, which causes cholinergic poisoning. It also attacks the melatonin receptors present in the human body [30]. It also adversely impacts the renal, neurological, reproductive, metabolic and immune systems in both humans and animals.

2.3.4. Pyrethroids and pyrethrins
Pyrethroid is an organic substance that resembles the natural pyrethrins produced by the pyrethrum flower. Most pyrethroids are derivatives of 2, 2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid. Allethrin was the first synthesized pyrethroid [31]. Pyrethroids can be generally undergo dissociation in sunlight and atmosphere in a day or two. However, they can persist for some time when associated with sediment. They are found in effluents at levels which are lethal to invertebrates [32]. Pyrethroids at lower levels are harmless to human beings as they are poorly absorbed by human skin but harmful to insects and fishes. Generally, the symptoms of pyrethroid poisoning are paresthesia, nausea, coma, pulmonary edema, vomiting, and so on.

On the other hand, pyrethrins are organic compounds derived from Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium. They exhibit insect-repellent as well as insecticidal properties. Compared to OPPs and OCPs, pyrethrins are considered a better choice of pesticide due to their lower toxicity and persistence [33]. They selectively kill targeted insects without harming mammals, due to the increased sensitivity of insect nerves, less absorption via mammalian skin, and effective hepatic metabolism in mammals. However, these can be harmful to mammals, causing toxicity and poisoning. Inhalation and skin absorption in humans can lead to chronic toxicity, allergic reactions, itching, and burning. Additionally, excessive use of pyrethrins can negatively impact the environment through bioaccumulation in aquatic and terrestrial organisms [34].

3. GRAPHENE-BASED materials
Graphene is a two-dimensional material composed of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal honeycomb lattice. It has exceptional properties such as high thermal conductivity, excellent electrical conductivity and mechanical properties, significant surface area, and specific magnetism. It has attracted significant scientific attention in various fields, including solar cells, field-effect transistors, sensors, supercapacitors, and transparent electrodes. Its chemical properties, large surface area, and unique geometry make it particularly promising for environmental pollution control and energy-related applications, which have generated interest among environmentalists [36,37]. Efforts are being made to modify the surface of graphene by attaching nanoparticles or other materials in various arrangements, resulting in unique properties and improved performance. These graphene-based materials have potential applications in memory devices, molecular imaging, biomedical science, drug delivery, pollution control, and energy development [38].

3.1. Types of graphene based materials
There are several materials based on graphene, which can be produced by incorporating graphene into other materials or by manipulating its structure [[38], [39], [40], [41]]. Some of the common graphene-based materials are:
a)
Graphene oxide (GO): It is a derivative of graphene that comprises various oxygen containing functional like, carboxyl (-COOH), hydroxyl (-OH), and epoxy (–COC–) groups. It is produced by oxidizing graphene using strong acids. It is easily dispersible in water and easily functionalized, making it useful for several applications such as water purification, catalysis, energy storage, biosensors and biomedicine [19,20]. Various researches utilized modified graphene oxide bonded with other materials in pesticide extractions in order to improve its sorption properties [[42], [43], [44]].

b)
Reduced graphene oxide (rGO): It is obtained by reducing GO, which removes oxygen-containing functional groups. It restores the electrical conductivity of graphene and is more conductive than GO. rGO is used in environmental remediation, optical sensors, electronic devices and energy storage [45]. Research including rGO coated with ZnO nanocomposites shows improved adsorption efficiency for the extraction of pesticides [46].

c)
Graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs): GNPs are nanoscale particles with a thickness of 5–10 nm and varying sizes up to 50 ?m. They are cheaper and easier to produce than single-layered graphene and carbon nanotubes. GNPs consist of platelet-shaped graphene sheets, offering a high surface area per unit mass compared to graphite and carbon nanotubes. Due to these features, GNPs are useful in diverse research areas, including adsorption and solid phase extraction for analytical purposes. They can be used as fillers in composites to improve mechanical and electrical properties [47,48].

d)
Graphene aerogels: They are lightweight materials with high porosity, mechanical strength and surface area, making them useful for energy storage, catalysis, and environmental remediation. These are made by freeze-drying a solution of graphene oxide. In a recent study, Sun et al. synthesized three-dimensional graphene aerogel (3D-GA) from graphene oxides and utilized it to determine OPPs [49]. The other example of such aerogel for extracting pesticides includes magnetic 3D-G-Fe3O4 [50].

e)
Graphene-based composites: They are materials in which graphene is combined with other materials such as polymers, metals, or ceramics. Graphene-based composites have improved mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties [51]. They are used in a wide range of applications such as aerospace, automotive, sensors, energy storage and electronics [38,[52], [53], [54]]. These can be classified as magnetic and non-magnetic. Various studies have proved that the magnetic graphene-based nanocomposites can be utilized as adsorbent in the determination and extraction of different pesticides. For instance, graphene-based tetraethoxysilane-methyltrimethoxysilane sol-gel hybrid magnetic nanocomposite (Fe3O4@G-TEOS-MTMOS) can be used for the determination of OPPs [55].


These are just a few examples of graphene-based materials. The versatility of graphene has led to the development of many other types of graphene-based materials, and their potential applications are still being explored.

Graphene-based materials have great potential for environmental remediation of pesticides due to their exceptional properties and versatility. The unique structure allows graphene-based materials to adsorb and remove a variety of pollutants, including pesticides, from contaminated water and soil. One of the main advantages of graphene-based materials for pesticide remediation is their high adsorption capacity. Studies have shown that GO and rGO can adsorb a wide range of pesticides, including glyphosate, atrazine, and carbendazim, with high efficiency. The adsorption process is attributed to the strong ?-? stacking interaction between the graphene-based materials and the pesticide molecules. Another advantage of graphene-based materials is their strong chemical stability, which allows them to maintain their structural integrity even under harsh environmental conditions. This property makes them an ideal candidate for long-term use in environmental remediation applications. These materials can also be easily synthesized and modified to enhance their adsorption properties [[14], [15], [16],[56], [57], [58], [59], [60]]. Functionalizing graphene-based materials with different groups can increase their selectivity towards specific pesticides, making them more effective in removing target pollutants. For example, the integration of amine-modified graphene membrane polyamide with a polysulfone (PSf) support significantly enhances the membrane functionality and characteristics [61]. Consequently, this integration proves to be promising for application in the wastewater treatment industry.

This review will cover various graphene-based materials in showing great potential as effective and sustainable candidates for the environmental remediation of pesticides. However, more research is needed to fully understand their performance in real-world applications and their potential environmental impact.

3.2. Fabrication of graphene based materials
Graphene is a one-atom-thick layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice. There are two main categories in terms of synthesizing graphene as single-layer graphene (SLG), bilayer graphene, or few-layer graphene (FLG): top-down and bottom-up approaches. Several methods have been discovered to obtain graphene, including chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition, and chemical synthesis. Fabrication of graphene-based materials involves several methods, each with its advantages and limitations. As a result, there is a growing demand for the development of techniques that can produce graphene in large quantities while maintaining high quality [62].

Several methods for graphene-based materials fabrication are listed below:
a)
Mechanical exfoliation: It is one of the earliest methods used to fabricate graphene-based materials. In this method, graphene-based materials are obtained from graphite through a process that involves repeatedly removing graphene layers using adhesive tape. This method is slow and only yields small amounts of graphene [63].

b)
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD): The CVD method involves the introduction of a carbon-containing gas into a furnace that is kept at high temperatures. This leads to the decomposition of the gas, resulting in the formation of graphene on a substrate made of a metal catalyst. CVD is a technique that enables the production of graphene films on a large scale. This method allows for the production of large-area graphene films with high quality, but it requires specialized equipment and skilled personnel [64].

c)
Reduced graphene oxide (rGO): It involves oxidizing graphite to form graphene oxide, followed by chemical or thermal reduction to produce rGO. This technique allows for the production of a large quantity of graphene sheets. The excellent properties of graphene can be partly regenerated by the reduction of the oxygen functional groups of GO. However, the quality of the resulting material is not as high as pristine graphene [65].

d)
Graphene composites: When graphene is combined with polymers, metals, or ceramics, it can create composites that exhibit improved strength, conductivity, and lightweight properties. It is a common method to prepare graphene-polymer composites, which involves fully exfoliating graphite and achieving a molecular-level dispersion of chemically modified graphene sheets within polymer matrices. This approach ensures that the individual graphene sheets are well-dispersed and integrated into the polymer host. Graphene oxide sheets are typically only dispersible in water, making them incompatible with most organic polymers. Furthermore, graphene oxide lacks electrical conductivity, unlike graphite, limiting its usefulness for conductive nanocomposites. However, chemical reduction can enhance the electrical conductivity of graphite oxide by restoring a graphitic network [66].


The selection of a specific method for producing graphene-based materials is reliant on the intended usage and the specific properties that the resulting material should possess. As technology advances, the techniques for producing graphene-based materials are also evolving. There are continuously emerging new methods to fabricate such materials. The selection of a particular method is determined by the intended application and the desired properties of the resulting material.

4. Extraction methods adopted for removal of pesticides
Pesticides are essential in agriculture to control pests and achieve maximum crop production. Nevertheless, excessive use and misuse of pesticides can cause health and environmental hazards. Toxic residues from pesticides can infiltrate the food chain via contaminated crops and wat",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Abstract
Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has been introduced to detect pesticides at low concentrations and in complex matrices to help developing countries monitor pesticides to keep their concentrations at safe levels in food and the environment. SERS is a surface-sensitive technique that enhances the Raman signal of molecules absorbed on metal nanostructure surfaces and provides vibrational information for sample identification and quantitation. In this work, we report the use of silver nanostars (AgNs) as SERS-active elements to detect four neonicotinoid pesticides (thiacloprid, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and nitenpyram). The SERS substrates were prepared with multiple depositions of the nanostars using a self-assembly approach to give a dense coverage of the AgNs on a glass surface, which ultimately increased the availability of the spikes needed for SERS activity. The SERS substrates developed in this work show very high sensitivity and excellent reproducibility. Our research opens an avenue for the development of portable, field-based pesticide sensors, which will be critical for the effective monitoring of these important but potentially dangerous chemicals.
Keywords: neonicotinoid pesticides; pesticide monitoring; SERS; silver nanostars
1. Introduction
Neonicotinoid pesticides, such as clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, have been restricted in the European Union but remain in use worldwide in the agricultural sector to meet the demands of population growth, urbanisation and market integration. Other neonicotinoid types commonly used to control pests are thiacloprid, dinotefuran, acetamiprid and sulfoxaflor. The demand for neonicotinoid pesticides for crop protection represents almost one-third of the global insecticide market due to their high insecticidal efficiency [1]. To control pests and reduce disease pressure on crops, the use of these pesticides as seed coatings in flowering crops is a widespread practice that can reduce overspray and spray drift. However, the pesticides used to treat the seeds can potentially be absorbed and spread through the tissue and reach pollen and nectars [2]. Then, insect pollinators such as honeybees and wild bees are exposed to the pesticides and bring them to their colonies [3]. The European Union announced a ban on the use of these chemicals after assessment studies from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) showed the negative effects of neonicotinoids on insect pollinators, including multiple responses on learning, memory performance and the feeding activity of bee species [4].
Neonicotinoid pesticides have similar chemical structures to nicotine and permanently bind with high infinity to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the insect central nervous system [5]. The active substances are neurotoxic and can overstimulate and disrupt the learning and memory behaviour of insect pollinators, resulting in brain damage. These negative impacts on the insect pollinators means they do not interact with crops as expected, affecting the yield and quality of the agricultural products, nutrient content and shelf life. Consequently, the decreasing value of pollinators’ services to agricultural systems leads to big effects on ecosystems and the world economy. Human and environmental exposure to the pesticides through release into the air, diffusion into water and relocation from seed to root, plant and nectar can mean that the pesticides linger for decades in the food chain, animals, humans and the environment. The impact of neonicotinoid pesticides on human health was investigated by Zhang’s group who reported neonicotinoid pesticide residue can be absorbed by the human body through surface water [6]. This can lead to memory loss, finger tremors, headaches, coughs, general fatigue and abdominal pain, as reported by Taira et al., who studied the neonicotinoid exposure in urine samples [7]. Hence, neonicotinoids are compounds of great concern because the active ingredients are systemic, persistent and have high solubility. Therefore, consistent monitoring and rigorous testing of pesticide residue are critical in all countries, especially developing countries.
Effective methods to detect the presence of pesticide residue in food and drinking water has been introduced owing to the increasing public awareness and government concern regarding pesticides’ impact on food security and human health. Tremendous techniques have been established for pesticide monitoring, such as liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS), gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays and capillary electrophoresis. The Rawat group detected imidacloprid, clothianidin, acetamprid and thiamethoxam in vegetables with a limit of the detection (LOD) at 0.5 µg/mL using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fitted with a UV-Vis detector [8]. The detection of thiacloprid with an LOD as low as 0.003 ng/mL using a time-resolved fluorescent microsphereimmunochromatographic test strip was reported by the Xu group by using recombinant antibodies [9]. Capillary electrophoresis methods with tandem mass spectroscopy were studied by Carbonell-Rozas’ group for the detection of nine neonicotinoid pesticides with an LOD as low as 1.25 × 10?5 g/mL [10]. Generally, these techniques have high sensitivity and are established as a major tool for pesticide identification and qualification. But these analytical techniques are laborious and time consuming, costly, require sophisticated instruments and experienced staff. Many developing countries cannot afford the expensive instruments or do not own sufficient instruments for the monitoring of pesticide residue in food or the environment. In contrast, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) offers faster analysis time, simpler protocols, low-cost operations and a field-deployable methodology for the identification and qualification of pesticide contamination. Several handheld Raman instruments are available from companies, such as Agilent Technologies, Bruker, Metrohm and Thermo Scientific, for the detection of low concentrations of materials typically in forensic situations. The production of commercial SERS substrates as ultrasensitive detectors as a sensing platform was developed by Nanova Inc. (Columbia, MO, USA), Hamamatsu Photonics (Hamamatsu city, Japan) and Renishaw Diagnostics (Glasgow, UK). However, this work seeks to establish an ultrasensitive detector that will allow the cheap, efficient, reliable mass production of sensing platforms, which would find applications in the detection of a wide range of toxins and other harmful chemicals. The outcomes will be precursors to significant steps towards the production of commercial sensors, which would help developing countries monitor a variety of environmentally harmful chemical species.
The discovery of Raman signal enhancement has opened the door for the first monitoring of single molecules in bioanalytics [11] and pesticides using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) by simply adsorbing organophosphorus pesticides on a silver surface as a SERS-active substrate [12]. Many publications have shown that the SERS effect is a powerful tool for the identification and qualification of pesticide contamination on the basis of their unique vibrational characteristics [13,14,15]. SERS is a highly sensitive technique that enhances the Raman intensities of molecules more than after adsorption on plasmonic nanostructured surfaces [16,17]. Subsequently, SERS has been continuously used to identify pesticide contaminations in aqueous systems [18] and in seawater [19].
In previous work, we synthesized star-shaped silver nanostructures and fabricated SERS substrates to use SERS enhancement of the Raman signal to detect the neonicotinoid imidacloprid. We studied the best distribution of silver nanostars (AgNs) on glass surfaces by varying the number of layers of AgNs thin films. These SERS substrates are promising for use in the field because detection without complex sample preparation is critical for real-world use in analytical facilities or more importantly in the field. Critically, it is important that such a sensor is sensitive to many different pesticides. The residue of the four pesticides tested in this work has become a global issue as their residues have been found in a variety of food products and environmental samples. Many countries have detected the residue of these pesticides in soil [20], water [6] and food products [21]. In the current work, we studied the four neonicotinoid pesticides on AgNs thin films. The pesticides were deposited on the AgNs surface by a drop-casting technique to observe the sensitivity and reproducibility of SERS substrates towards the neonicotinoid pesticides. This AgNs substrate was found to be a good SERS-active substrate for all the molecules, giving large SERS enhancements and excellent reproducibility with a low relative standard derivation of SERS intensity.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Materials
The four neonicotinoid pesticides used for the SERS measurements were imidacloprid-pestanal, (Analytical standard, Sigma-Aldrich (Sydney, Australia)), thiamethoxam-pestanal, (Analytical standard, Sigma-Aldrich (Sydney, Australia)), thiacloprid-pestanal (Analytical standard, Sigma-Aldrich (Sydney, Australia)) and nitenpyram-pestanal, (Analytical standard, Sigma-Aldrich (Sydney, Australia)). The solvent for preparing the pesticide solutions was methanol (Analytical Reagent Grade, Chem-Supply Pty Ltd (Adelaide, Australia)) and deionized water. The chemicals for the preparation of silver nanostars (AgNs) are silver nitrate (?99.0%, Sigma Aldrich (Sydney, Australia)), sodium hydroxide (?98.0%, Chem-Supply Pty Ltd (Adelaide, Australia)), hydroxylamine 50 wt. % in water (Sigma Aldrich, Sydney, Australia) and trisodium citrate dehydrate (?99.0%, Sigma Aldrich (Sydney, Australia)). Toluene, (Analytical Reagent Grade, Chem-Supply Pty Ltd, (Adelaide, Australia)) and n,n-dimethylformamide (?99.8%, Sigma Aldrich (Sydney, Australia)) were used for the fabrication of monolayer AgNs films. These chemicals were used as received without any further purification.
2.2. Methodology
The synthesis of the colloidal silver nanostars (AgNs) and the fabrication of the silver nanostars film were described in our previous article [22]. Colloidal AgNs was prepared by a chemical reduction technique by mixing 2.0 mL of 6.0 × 10?2 M hydroxylamine into 2.0 mL of 5 × 10?2 M sodium hydroxide. This mixture was stirred, and the solution colour changed to dark grey after adding 9.0 mL of 1 × 10?3 M silver nitrate and 0.1 mL of 1% w/v trisodium citrate dehydrate into the solution. The colloidal suspension was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 15 min. The pellet was collected and further used for the fabrication of SERS substrates. AgNs SERS substrates were prepared on glass surfaces using a self-assembly technique. The monolayer AgNs film was prepared by mixing 12.0 mL colloidal AgNs and 6.0 mL toluene to obtain the water–oil interface. The monolayer AgNs films were transferred onto the solid substrate by placing the silicon or glass substrate surface under the formed monolayer solution and the substrate was further dried at 60 °C for 1 h in an oven. This process was repeated multiple times to prepare 10 layers of AgNs films on the substrate surfaces.
Neonicotinoid pesticide solutions were prepared at 1 mg/mL concentration by dissolving 1 mg of the pesticides in 0.5 mL of methanol. The mixture was placed in an ultrasonic bath to dissolve the solid. After that, the pesticide solution was added to 0.5 mL of deionized water. This 1 mg/mL pesticide solution was used as the stock solution to prepare seven concentrations, namely 1 × 100, 1 × 10?1, 1 × 10?2, 1 × 10?3, 1 × 10?4, 1 × 10?5 and 1 × 10?6 mg/mL. These various concentrations were prepared by diluting 1 mg/mL of pesticide solutions with the appropriate amount of deionized water. For SERS measurements, the pesticide was dropped and dried on the AgNs surface and bare-glass surface.
The SERS measurements were performed using a Renishaw model InVia micro Raman spectrometer with 785 nm wavelength diode laser. The Raman spectra of the pesticide powders on glass slides were recorded using a 50× objective at 100% of the 167 mW power laser with 5-second integration time for reference spectra. The SERS spectra of the pesticides on the silver nanostars surface were collected using a 50x objective at 1% of the 167 mW power laser with 5-second integration time. SERS sensor properties such as sensitivity and reproducibility towards the pesticide detection were observed in this work. The reusability and stability of the SERS substrate were reported in a previous article [22].
2.3. Computional Model
Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression was used to perform multivariate analysis on spectroscopic data. Python codes using the libraries numpy, scikit-learn and scipy were used for SG filtering and PLS regression. The SG filtering was implemented using the savgol_filter function from the scipy.signal module. PLS regression was carried out using the PLSRegression class from the sklearn.cross decomposition module while cross-validation predictions were made using the cross_val_predict function from sklearn.model selection.
A Savitzky–Golay filter was applied to smooth the spectra and calculate the first derivative of the spectra, which is used in the analysis. The optimal number of PLS components and the relevant wavelengths are determined by optimising the R2 and mean square error of cross-validated data. To improve the performance of the model, the values of the concentrations were transformed using the logarithm function, which helps to linearize the relationship between the predictor variables (spectra), and the response variable (concentration) reduces the effect of outliers and spreads the values out more evenly across the range of possible values. This improves the stabilization of the response variable and makes the model more sensitive to small changes at low concentrations. The regression graphs were plotted using Microsoft Excel 2010.
3. Results
In this report, we used a AgNs substrate prepared through 10 subsequential layer depositions of silver nanostars (AgNs) on a glass surface as the SERS substrate, as described in our previous article [22]. To comprehensively study the SERS performance for various neonicotinoid pesticides on the SERS substrates, we collected the Raman spectra of neonicotinoid pesticide powders for the reference of neonicotinoid characteristic peaks. Figure 1A–D show the Raman spectra of four neonicotinoid pesticide powders, namely thiacloprid, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and nitenpyram. The characteristic Raman peaks for each pesticide were obvious. The chemical structures of these pesticides are attached in the SI, Figure S1.

The sensitivity of the SERS substrate was studied by observing the Raman spectrum of the pesticides on a glass surface and on the AgNs surface using the same solution concentration for the drop casting and same laser configuration but 100-times less power for the experiments on the SERS substrates. Figure 2A–D display the Raman spectra of the pesticides on the glass surface and on the AgNs surface at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. Based on the SERS spectra, the characteristic peaks of the pesticides on the AgNs surface match those observed for the pesticides on the glass surface. The observed characteristic peaks of the absorbed pesticides on silver nanostars are in good agreement with the observed characteristic peaks of pesticide powders. The details of the characteristic peaks for the pesticide powder, on glass surface and on AgNs, are discussed in the SI, Tables S1–S4. The intensity of the characteristic peaks of these pesticides at 1 mg/mL was clearly enhanced after the absorption of the pesticides on the silver surface compared to the low Raman intensity of the pesticides on bare glass surfaces at 1 mg/mL. To calculate the Enhancement Factor (EF) of SERS performance, some of the highest peaks at 2174 cm?1, 295 cm?1, 759 cm?1 and 1102 cm?1 were chosen for thiacloprid, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and nitenpyram, respectively. The calculated EFs for thiacloprid, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and nitenpyram detection were 3.61 × 105, 2.86 × 104, 9.53 × 104 and 2.40 × 105, respectively. There are a few EF formulae for EF calculations and, here, we chose the Analytical Enhancement Factor approach, as described by Ru et al.’s group [23]. These EF values were calculated using Formula (1).

SERS enhancement happens through two mechanisms, namely an electromagnetic (EM) mechanism and a chemical (CM) mechanism [16,24,25]. The EM mechanism is generally observed on substrates rich in free electrons that can generate localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) upon excitation [26]. The CM mechanism can have three possible origins in a metal–molecule system, namely interfacial ground-state charge transfer, photoinduced charge transfer resonance and the electronic excitation resonance within the molecule itself [27]. In our experiments, the laser wavelength is 1.58 eV, while the pesticides examined have energy gaps ranging from 2.084 to 7.94 eV; thus, resonance Raman of the molecule itself is not possible [28]. The Fermi level of silver nanoparticles is generally about ?4.26 eV [29], meaning that in all cases, the energy of the LUMO is higher than the Fermi level of AgNs, while the energy level of the HOMO is below the Fermi level. As shown in Table 1, the gaps between the levels for each molecule and the Ag Fermi level vary dramatically but, in all cases, significant SERS enhancement is observed. The large gaps between the LUMOs and the Fermi level mean that a photoinduced charge transfer resonance mechanism is unlikely [29]. Thus, this means that the most likely SERS enhancement mechanism is a combination of electromagnetic enhancement due to surface plasmon excitation in the metal nanoparticles [30] and interfacial ground-state charge transfer. These ground state interactions change the polarizability of the metal–molecule complex, leading to higher Raman cross-sections. Importantly, despite a range of HOMO energy levels of over 2.5 eV, the SERS substrate gives high enhancements for all the pesticides, highlighting the wide applicability of this approach to detect many species of environmental concern.

The detection reproducibility of the SERS substrate for the four pesticides was tested by collecting the SERS spectra of pesticides at 20 different spots on the same sample surface. Five spectra of five different spots for each of the four pesticides are plotted in Figure 3A–D. However, the full SERS spectra of 20 different spots for four pesticides on AgNs surfaces are provided in the SI, Figure S2. The three highest-intensity characteristic peaks for each pesticide were chosen to calculate the relative standard derivation (RSD) and observe the uniformity field enhancement of the SERS substrate.

Figure 4A–D show the SERS intensity versus Raman shift for the three highest-intensity characteristic peaks of the pesticides on the AgNs surface at 1 mg/mL concentration. Based on the RSD results, the AgNs created good local field enhancements for the SERS detection of these pesticides by showing major uniform enhancement. The absorption of pesticides on the uniform surface coverage of the silver nanostars clusters with their many spikes yields good SERS reproducibility. The calculated RSD for the four pesticides is as low as 7.26%, and the highest is 27.16%. The SERS substrate showed good reproducibility for thiacloprid detection and the low reproducibility for the nitenpyram detection.

We further studied the limit of detection of the SERS substrate for these pesticides. Figure 5A–D plot the SERS spectra for different concentrations, ranging from 1 ng/mL to 1 mg/mL of the four pesticides on the AgNs surface. We found that, as expected, a decreasing pesticide concentration gave decreasing SERS intensities. The characteristic peaks of these pesticides at lowest concentration on the AgNs surface are still observable. Using a signal-to-noise ratio of 2 to 1, the limits of detection (LOD) for thiacloprid, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and nitenpyram were determined and found to be 1.72 × 10?6 mg/mL, 9.4 × 10?8 mg/mL, 4.83 × 10?6 mg/mL and 7.65 × 10?7 mg/mL, respectively, on the AgNs surface. The results from the Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression show excellent agreement for all pesticides tested, as shown in Figure 6A–D. These good correlations for these four pesticides show that the SERS substrates could be used to estimate pesticide residue in the environment and food products at very low concentrations, as required by the current limits set by regulatory agencies.

4. Discussion
The use of silver nanostars has not previously been observed for the detection of thiacloprid, thiamethoxam and nitenpyram pesticides. However, the detection of imidacloprid has been reported using a silver nanoflower [35] and gold-coated silver nanoflower SERS substrate [14]. The sensitivity observed using AgNs is similar to that observed with silver nanoflowers in terms of the limits of detection for imidacloprid using SERS substrates. However, the addition of gold to silver nanoflowers has been shown to improve the sensitivity by a factor of approximately 100. Other recent reports have used roughened silver [13] and palladium nanoparticles on meso-porous silicon [36] as SERS substrates, and they have exhibited very similar limits of detection for imidacloprid. This finding is beneficial for estimating the imidacloprid residue in food products, since the result is significantly lower than the current allowable limit of residue in fruit by the Chinese government, set at 1.91–3.91 mol/L (4.89 × 10?4 mg/mL to 10.0 × 10?4 mg/mL), and by the European Union at 0.5 mg/kg (5 × 10?4 mg/mL) [15].
A combination of silver and gold nanoparticles has been reported to detect thiacloprid with a limit of detection of 9.6 × 10?2 mg/mL [37], 2.3 × 10?5 mg/mL in milk [38], 1.0 × 10?5 mg/mL in peach [39] and 4.0 × 10?4 mg/mL using silver and gold hydrosols [40]. Interestingly, the thiacloprid detected using AgNs is significantly lower than reported by other researchers, and the current allowable limit of residue in honey by the European Union is 200 µg/kg (2 × 10?4 mg/mL) [40]. Thiamethoxam has been detected using silver nanoparticle films at a limit of 3.7 × 10?1 mg/mL [41], 3.0 × 10?4 mg/mL [42] and 3.0 × 10?6 mg/mL in fruit by silver nanoparticles decorated with cellulose and DNA [21]. Meanwhile, a gold-embedded chitosan SERS substrate had a similar LOD to this project at 1.0 × 10?6 mg/mL on fruit peels [43]. This value is significantly lower than the current allowable limit of thiacloprid residue in fruit by the United States Environmental Protection Agency of 2.0 × 10?5 mg/mL to 6.0 × 10?3 mg/mL [43]. One article reporting the use of a silver dendrite with a fern structure as the SERS substrate to detect nitenpyram in apple surfaces had an LOD of 1.2 × 10?3 mg/mL [44]. The AgNs used in this project provided a more sensitive surface for low concentrations of nitenpyram. We also provide, in Table 2, the wider range of previous works toward the detection of pesticides, chemical traces and biomaterials in complex samples.

5. Conclusions
We detected four neonicotinoid pesticides on a silver nanostars (AgNs) surface using surface-enhanced Raman scattering. The developed SERS substrates with a dense coverage of the AgNs on a glass surface in this work show very high sensitivity and excellent reproducibility towards four types of neonicotinoid pesticides (thiacloprid, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and nitenpyram) in a detection range from 1 ng/mL to 1 mg/mL. The results revealed that the AgNs surface is sensitive to four types of pesticides, and the calculated EFs for thiacloprid, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and nitenpyram detection were 3.61 × 105, 2.86 × 104, 9.53 × 104 and 2.40 × 105, respectively. The range of electronic properties of the four compounds tested suggests that this system will have wide-ranging use for the detection of many molecules. The use of silver nanostars as a SERS-active element to detect these four neonicotinoid pesticides without complex sample preparation is critical for real-world use in analytical facilities or, more importantly, in the field. The data presented clearly detail the sensor sensitivity and reproducibility—all critical for analytical use. Additionally, the very high sensitivity demonstrated means there is no doubt that the sensor would still provide strong signals using a handheld Raman instrument, meaning that use in the field by non-experts is without doubt feasible. Importantly, based on these experiments, the sensor will have a long shelf life and still provide very high sensitivity to a wide range of molecules, making it ideal for field use, where a range of molecular species will be present.

"Abstract
Chiral organic pollutants, including pesticides, herbicides, medicines, flame retardants, and polycyclic musk, represent a significant threat to both the environment and human health. The presence of asymmetric centers in the structure of chiral pesticides introduces stereoisomers with distinct distributions, fates, biomagnification capacities, and cytotoxicities. In aquatic environments, pesticides, as persistent/pseudo-persistent compounds, have been detected in substantial quantities, posing severe risks to non-target species and, ultimately, public health through water supply and food exposures. In response to this environmental challenge, stereoselective analytical methods have gained prominence for the identification of pesticide/drug enantiomers in recent years. This review examines the environmental impact of chiral pesticides, emphasizing the distinct biological activities and distribution patterns of their stereoisomers. By highlighting the advancements in liquid chromatography for enantiomeric analysis, the review aims to underscore the urgent need for a comprehensive understanding of these pollutants to facilitate informed remediation strategies and ensure the safer dispersal of chiral organic pollutants in the environment, thereby addressing the potential risks they pose to ecosystems and human health. Future research should focus on developing sustainable and efficient methodologies for the precise analysis of stereoisomers in complex matrices, particularly in sewage water, emphasizing the importance of sewage processing plants in ensuring water quality.

Introduction
The importance of water in modern technological civilization, from a health, economic, and, most importantly, a contemporary standpoint, cannot be overstated. Water for human consumption, agricultural, technical, commercial, or household purposes, must meet specific standards that are closely related to both water quality and delivery. Growing industrialization, poor water quality, purposeful or inadvertent intrusion of hazardous components and/or contaminants, and unequal allocation of freshwater resources are all factors that limit water availability (Leal Filho et al., 2022). Although treated wastewater might well be contaminated with bacteria and trace amounts of hazardous compounds, especially those integrated by manmade activities via direct point contamination or indirect routes such as effluent discharge and surface drainage, it is challenging. Moreover, freshwater rivers and streams for potable water processing plants can be located inside the waterway network that serves as a wastewater treatment plant discharge location simultaneously.

Anthropogenic activities have resulted in widespread pollution of the native surroundings associated with rapid socioeconomic growth. Caused by human activities, organic pollutants have now diffused across the environment and could be particularly resistant to breakdown operations in microbial populations (Akhtar et al., 2021). Several persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are no longer manufactured or used in many countries across the world due to their detrimental effects on wildlife and humans.

There has been a significant amount of attention and extensive research on new organic contaminants across the world, and there is a rising need to control such compounds to fully understand the hazards that pose threats to human health and the environment (Yadav et al., 2021). The detection or characterization of organic pollutants might be used to indicate human activity in a certain environment. Although there is a priority on traditional pollutants, especially those that are tenacious, such as synthetic chemicals, agrochemicals, and disinfection by-products, emerging organic pollutants, such as medical products and basic commodities, hormone levels, illicit narcotics, degradation products, and algal microbes or other biochemically derived organisms, have started to acquire significant attention (Khan et al., 2022). Pesticides and other agrochemicals, for example, could imply commercial agriculture or hygienic facilities (Dhananjayan et al., 2020), while organometallic chemicals, polychlorinated biphenyls, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons could be markers of metropolitan pollution, or run-off from manufacturing plants (Singh et al., 2022). When such compounds enter the aquatic ecosystem, they may have negative effects on humans, animals, and aquatic species. Moreover, plenty of the synthetic organic pollutants disposed into waterways by individuals, industry, and wildlife are considered to be dangerous compounds, and many others may not degrade fast, but rather accumulate in the environment or food supply (Unuofin, 2020; Rathi et al., 2021).

Novelty statement
This comprehensive review distinguishes itself by providing a focused exploration of the environmental impact of chiral pesticides, emphasizing the distinctive biological activities and distribution patterns of their stereoisomers. In a novel approach, the review integrates the urgent need for a comprehensive understanding of chiral organic pollutants (COPs) with the advancements in liquid chromatography for enantiomeric analysis, thereby offering a unique perspective on the identification and characterization of pesticide/drug enantiomers. By intertwining environmental risks, stereoselective analytical methods, and potential remediation strategies, this review contributes a nuanced and timely synthesis that advances our comprehension of the complexities surrounding chiral organic pollutants, promoting informed decision-making for safeguarding ecosystems and human health.

Stereochemical features of chiral pesticides
Chiral pesticides have been of great interest in the growth of environmental science and comprise chemicals like insecticides, fertilizers, medicines, fire repellents, and synthesized PCBs muscle, offering a wide range of physicochemical characteristics and uses (Hassaan & El Nemr, 2020). Agrochemicals are typically sold as a racemic mixture, even though their biocompatibility is primarily tied to a single stereoisomer (Musarurwa & Tavengwa, 2020). Approximately one-third of available pesticides exhibit chirality, with many being utilized as racemates despite the fact that optimal activity often resides in a specific enantiomer (Tudi et al., 2021). This practice may lead to adverse effects on non-target organisms, as evidenced by studies on environmental fate, field experiments, toxicology, and biodegradation related to some widely used pesticides (Meng et al., 2022). Therefore, if stereoselective binding takes place, standard ecological risk estimates of chiral pesticides are inappropriate. Consequently, it is crucial to establish sensitive and trustworthy methodologies for quantifying chiral pesticides to comprehend their behavior, distribution, and fate as well as to properly estimate the risks they pose to humans and the environment. The presence and enantiomeric compositions of chiral pesticides in aqueous systems (like a river or industrial effluent and outflow wastewater), soils, cereals, plants, and fruits have received a lot of interest (Lucci et al., 2022).

Several pesticides with one or more asymmetric centers were commonly found in water resources, including surface water, groundwater, seawater, and numerous reservoirs, as a result of extensive use (Yao et al., 2015a). Nevertheless, a few examples of agrochemicals that are available as pure enantiomers include various pyrethroid insecticides, aryloxypropanoate herbicides, and triazole fungicides (Maia et al., 2017; Sharma et al., 2021). Around one-third of the pesticides on the marketplace are chiral, and the majority of them are sold as a racemic mixture even though the desired activities depend on one single enantiomer and the others can create toxic or adversative effects on non-targeting species. There has been little awareness paid to pesticide chirality, particularly in terms of toxicological effects and potential ecological risks (Ji et al., 2023). The potential adverse effects due to the use of chiral pesticides are shown in Fig. 1.

The environmental hazards of pesticides have customarily been assessed mainly due to their specific structural features. Research findings started in the 1990s showed that microbes are inclined to deteriorate hexachlorocyclohexane enantiomers selectively (Hühnerfuss et al., 1995), and the variations in distribution patterns and promising bioaccumulation among enantiomers in the ecosystem could occur (Garrison, 2006). Six primary classifications of worldwide employed chiral pesticides were investigated since 2002. In a report utilizing LC50, one of the stereoisomers showed at least ten times more hepatotoxicity than their counter stereoisomers to freshwater resources invertebrates C. dubia and D. magna, in the case of some synthetic pyrethroid (SP) and organophosphates (OPs).

Classification of chiral pesticides
There are six main classes of chiral pesticides.

(i) Synthetic pyrethroids (SPs)
SPs are synthetic counterparts of natively occurring pyrethrins derived from dried blooms of C. cineraria folium (Matsuo, 2019). Typically, the pyrethroid possesses two or more chiral centers, with an acidic group, an alcoholic group, or both groups. Consequently, the majority of pyrethroids occur as two or four enantiomer or diastereomer pairs, rendering them the pesticide class having a large number of asymmetric centers in their framework. At the beginning of the 1980s, SPs were established in numerous species of insects and are extensively utilized in farming and the household (Chen & Wang, 1996). Nonetheless, in the ecological investigation, the fate and/or cytotoxicity variations between the individual SP diastereomers have been rarely examined, mainly because of the lack of single-enantiomer standards (Kaziem et al., 2020) and the difficulty in detection and separation of the stereoisomers. The structural framework of various pesticides is presented in Fig. 2.

(ii) Organophosphates (OPs)
OPs are usually synthetic esters, phosphoric acid, phosphonothioate, phosphonothioic acid, amides, or thiol derivates. Chiral OPs can be classified into three basic classifications: chiral compounds containing P, C, and C and P chiral centers (Mukherjee & Gupta, 2020). To date, most chiral OPs are available as racemates in the marketplace. Though, pesticide activity is typically based on the superior activity of one stereoisomer, whereas the other may display toxicity on non-targeted species (Carrão et al., 2020). For instance, the severe aquatic toxicity to C. dubia and D. magna indicated that (–)-trichloronate (Fig. 3b) was 8–11-folds more noxious than its (?+)-enantiomer, and (?+)-methamidophos (Fig. 3c) was 7-folds more noxious than its (–)-counterpart (Kaziem et al., 2020). Furthermore, the stereoselective toxicities of numerous OPs and their separations were described (Badr, 2020). The (?+) stereoisomer of O, O-dimethyl-1-(4-chlorophenoxyacetoxy) ethyl phosphonate was 8.08-fold higher noxious than its (–)-stereoisomer in serious toxic effects on D. magna. The structures of several important OPs are presented in Fig. 3.

(iii) Acylanilides
Acylanilide (Fig. 2) herbicides are broadly employed and are of particular interest to the fate of these synthetic organic molecules. Metolachlor (Fig. 3d) is a representative member of the acylanilide class of pesticides. It possesses two chiral centers and is thus available in the form of four isomers. It is a popular and selective acylanilide herbicide for regulating widespread broad-leaved weeds in maize and other plants. The herbicidal potency of metolachlor lies principally in only two stereoisomers (aSS) and (aRS) (Moser et al., 1982). Benalaxyl (BEN, Fig. 3e) is another significant member of acylanilide. Primarily, it was developed in 1981 and was employed for control of oomycetes, predominantly fungi of the class Peronosporaceae, Phytophthora plasmopara, and Pythium spp. BEN encompasses a pair of stereoisomers with a chiral center in the alkyl group.

(iv) Imidazolinones
Imidazolinones were introduced at the beginning of the 1980s by the American Cyanamid Company and were extensively used as herbicides for a variety of agro products. Imidazolinones contain a chiral center in their structural framework (Fig. 2). Investigations of stereoselectivity in herbicidal potency suggested that the (R)-imazethapyr (Fig. 3f) displayed ten times more inhibition to acetolactate synthase than the (S)-form (Huang, 2012).

(v) Phenoxypropanoic-acid herbicides
Phenoxypropanoic acid (PA) pesticides (Fig. 2) were developed as systemic and post-emergence pesticides between the 1940s and 1950s. Mecoprop (Fig. 3g) and dichlorprop (Fig. 3h) are typical chiral PA pesticides. They are used in farming, gardens, grasslands, and industrial enterprises to control wide-leaf weeds. Mecoprop and dichlorprop both have a chiral center. Their (R)-form is recognized to possess a higher herbicide potency compared to the (S)-form (Tsuda et al., 1985). The racemic combinations are still mainly employed, discharging significant quantities of stereoisomer sediment into the area with uncertain ecotoxicology for non-targeting vegetation.

(vi) Triazole-related fungicides
The triazole-based fungicides possess one or two chiral centers in their structures and were primarily established in the mid-1970s. Triazole-based pesticides are employed on fruit trees, smaller fruits, veggies, and grasses. The structure of this type of pesticide contains asymmetric centers of triazole fungicides at the adjacent position of the 1,2,4-triazole ring (Fig. 2).

Objective and focus of the review
This review highlights and analyzes the recent advances in environmental monitoring and environmental decontamination. The present state and origins of pesticide chemicals, possible health hazards, superiority, disadvantages, and prospects of existing advanced cleanup procedures are also discussed. We highlighted the research and the application of these environmental management practices monitoring and chiral pesticide analysis, notably liquid chromatography. The stereoselective detection and assessment of chiral pesticides in ecological samples utilizing liquid chromatography are presented in this review.

Detection and remediation of chiral pesticides
Environmental monitoring of pesticides has been thoroughly studied recently (Huang et al., 2017; Lozowicka et al., 2016). Unfortunately, there has been a relatively limited study done on the stereoselective assessment of chiral pesticides in environmental matrixes. Previously, the majority of enantio-separation methods for the analysis of chiral pesticides were mostly based on liquid chromatography (Cheng et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2016). The variety of enantioselective separation technologies is quickly increasing due to the emergence of new chiral stationary phases and their capacity to work in multifunctional modes (normal, reverse, or polar organic modes) (Linhart et al., 2019). There are several approaches developed for detecting pesticides in sediment samples in both liquid and solid phases. Identification of chiral pesticides from aquatic specimens has also been done using a variety of approaches. It is indeed possible that this is due to their strong adsorption specificity for soil particles. As pollutants in the groundwater are so little, their analytical processes should incorporate both treatment and pre-concentration to achieve the projected detection sensitivity.

Pharmaceutical analysis in drug development is primarily concerned with techniques for identifying and quantifying potential drug candidates, determining purity, identifying by-products and degradation products in suitability and stability testing, and determining the fate of the active substance in the organism. Different chromatographic and capillary electrophoresis approaches are the most common analytical methods used to identify and quantify chiral pesticides. Vashistha’s research group has been studying the chirality of pharmacologically significant chemicals since the discovery of enantioselective chromatographic techniques several years previously (Vashistha et al., 2022a; Vashistha, 2022b; Vashistha et al., 2022b; Gupta et al., 2022; Bhardwaj & Vashistha, 2022; Vashistha et al., 2017; Vashistha & Bhushan, 2019; Vashistha & Bhushan, 2020; Kumar Vashistha, 2022a, 2022b; Vashistha & Kumar, 2020; Kumar Vashistha, 2022). Enantiospecific synthesis, characterization, and testing are problematic with asymmetric substances. When certain compounds are intentionally introduced into the environment, much more complicated challenges arise in terms of detecting, monitoring, and predicting their fate and hazards. In respect of expense, bio-remediation outperforms physical remediation procedures by achieving complete biological pollutant decomposition avoiding indiscriminately waste of locally available resources and indigenous fauna and flora. Nonetheless, in natural biological evolution, particularly spontaneous mutation, the bioremediation ability of native bacteria is commonly reduced in contaminated locations, particularly when multiple bioremediation characteristics are required, like co-contaminated regions with more than one organic substance.

Enantioselective degradation of chiral pesticides has been observed in soils, sediments, waterways, and plants (Buerge et al., 2016; Yao et al., 2015b), which could result in enantiomer concentration of more or less harmful stereoisomers. The method could be biologically (through microbes) or chemically driven (by chemical reaction). Various methods of bioremediation of pesticides are discussed below in sub-sections.

Acclimation
Monitoring for indigenous pathogens is thought to be an effective option because such varieties may be able to endure excessive wastewater conditions (Xiong et al., 2017). Various target strains necessitate distinct functioning processes; nevertheless, such processes can be broadly categorized. During this methodology, the deformation is enriched in the existence of variable concentrations of precursors based on the objectives. A combination of genetic manipulation and non-genetic recruitment can be used to cultivate facultative cultivars (Zhou et al., 2017).

When the environmental conditions are altered, organisms often undergo an acclimatization phase to maintain balance in internal systems, which affects gene expression (Corcoran et al., 2019). According to one study, S. intermedius may be trained to tolerate lindane contamination in the range of 5 to 120 mg/L while still removing the substance with an efficiency of 99% (Borowitzka, 2018).

Bacterial immobilization
In the domain of phytoremediation, immobilization relates to a technique for putting free microorganisms in a specified geographical area by chemical or physical methods to maintain them functional and reusable (Patel et al., 2018). Because of the aforementioned key characteristics, the immobilization technique may be a viable substitute for traditional remediation techniques: (i) highly maintained cell catalytic performance and cell density, (ii) easy separation and robust reusability, and (iii) enhanced preservation attributable to safeguard from harsh conditions (Mohamad et al., 2015; Derakhshan Nejad et al., 2018). There have been reports of using immobilized algae to remove pollutants.

The various kinds of regularly utilized immobilization techniques include surface adsorption, covalent bonding, cross-linking, and embedding (Sun et al., 2017; Vasilieva et al., 2018). Because of its simplicity of use and non-toxicity, surface adsorption is the most used technique among these. The key to the immobilization technique is the choice of carrier, which can include plant fibers, sugarcane bagasse, sawdust, corncobs, and expanded perlite (Dzionek et al., 2016). Diatomaceous earth, alginate, ion exchange resin, chitosan, and cellulose are examples of popular immobilization carriers. Both organic and inorganic materials may be exploited as immobilization carriers (Górecka & Jastrz?bska, 2019).

Nonetheless, the acquisition of bioremediation competence by native bacteria in polluted environments via natural biological development, such as random mutagenesis, commonly happens at an irrationally sluggish rate, particularly when numerous bio-degradation properties are taken into consideration necessary, as in the particular instance of locations co-contaminated with numerous organic substances. Biodegradation refers to the process by which organic contaminants are broken away via bacteria. In contrast to physical and chemical approaches, phytoremediation does have the benefit of becoming less expensive, and the total breakdown of COPs may be accomplished without causing any harm to the natural surroundings. Strategies for microbial decontamination must be designed in a consistent manner, which involves the following steps:

(i)
the development of unified microbes in which desirable enzymes or phytoremediation methods from diverse species are integrated for specific cell responses; or

(ii)
the development of enzymatic reactions with desirable distinctive features through location-specific mutagenesis (protein level).

Because enzymes comprise folded structures, even little changes in amino acid sequencing can modify their enzymatic performance, and the extent of the effect on other biological characteristics is practically hard to anticipate. Biomedical engineering (BME) might be used advantageously in bioremediation procedures to boost the capability of enzymes or bacteria. To meet the demand for microbes and enzymes for the bio-degradation of POPs, two major BME techniques involving genetically engineered pathogens and performance-enhancing have been established. Nonetheless, BME has several downsides, such as the difficulty of creating enzymes with unique functionalities. Furthermore, before this research, the whole structural, mechanical, and dynamic properties of the enzyme are required, and X-ray crystallographic and bioinformatics are the methodologies of choice for such examinations.

The phytoremediation of chiral pesticides is a fast-expanding area of interest. The primary goal of the study is to alter enzymes that can react to the intended outcome. As a result, using BME for the phytoremediation of novel pollutants could be difficult. Researchers estimate that breakthroughs in the knowledge of enzyme structure, activity, folding, routes, and dynamics would enable the functionalization of these enzymes (Derakhshan et al., 2019). The applications of these BME approaches for enhancing microorganisms’ capacity to bioremediate insecticides and prescription medicines in the surroundings are explored here.

Chiral pesticides enter the soil habitat by a variety of routes, including transformation or decomposition, sorption–desorption, evaporation, absorption by florae, overflow to surface waters, and transit to subterranean water. Transformation or decomposition is a distinct and important technique that governs the ecological availability and movement of chiral pesticides, comprising a variety of actions such as abiotic and biotic degradation (Fig. 4). Chiral pesticides can be metabolized to byproducts or completely mineralized into individual elements during these operations.

Giri and co-workers highlighted various bioremediation technologies for pesticide degradation. The review was focused on the impact of various environmental factors on the biodegradation of pesticides (Shekher Giri et al., 2020). These factors include pesticide structure, concentration, pH, temperature, and moisture of soils. The review also discusses the bioremediation methods for the degradation of organophosphate, organochlorine, carbamates, and pyrethroid pesticides in soil and aquatic systems. A comparison in terms of the benefits and disadvantages of current bioremediation techniques and conventional physicochemical methods for the bioremediation of pesticides has been analyzed.

Atrazine (ATZ, Fig. 3i) herbicide featured a family of s-triazine herbicides that was developed in the 1950s. Pseudomonas sp. ADP, among several studies of microorganisms, has been found accountable for atrazine metabolic routes (de Souza et al., 1995; Sadowsky et al., 1998). During the biological degradation of atrazine with Pseudomonas sp. ADP, ATZ is degraded to cyanuric acid utilizing the ATZ A, B, and C enzymes, which are consequently mineralized to CO2 and NH3 by enzymes that frequently originated in earthy microorganisms.

OPs are substantially lethal neurotoxins utilized in pesticides and warfare chemicals. Pesticides like paraoxon, chlorpyrifos, and parathion (Fig. 3j–l) are listed in the OP family. According to a recent study, toxic effects and the biodegradation of the enantiomers of chiral pesticides show different enantioselectivity. For instance, the (–)-fonofos (Fig. 3m), an OP insecticide, was fifteen times more noxious to C. dubia and C. magna than (?+)-fonofos. The rate of biodegradation of the fonofos stereoisomers has not been described. The (?+)-enantiomer of cis-bifenthrin was?~?20-fold more lethal than the (–) form to both C. magna and C. dubia and was also more insistent since the (–)-form was predominantly decayed by microorganisms (Liu et al., 2005).

Studies revealed that selective degradation by microbes resulted in the enhancement of one enantiomer against another enantiomer. Such alterations in the stereoisomeric content can be generated by physiologically mediated chiral inversion. Determination of stereo-configuration of trace COPs is a challenge, and therefore, a methodical strategy is required for reducing risk evaluation uncertainty that includes incidence, fate, and transportation in diverse environment variables of these contaminants (Sanganyado et al., 2017). For quantification of enantiomers, GC–MS was the process of selection, followed by the use of LC–MS using CSP (Bose et al., 2021) and using a modified ?-CD column and methyl-derivatized ? -CD columns (Abad-Gil & Marina, 2023). Decomposition of chloroacetanilide herbicides metolachlor (MET), acetochlor, and alachlor (Fig. 3n-o) and related microbial cultures was assessed in vertical up-flow wetland columns employing a blend of hydro-chemical and DNA-based methods. The mass decomposition of chloroacetanilides, which were consistently procured at 1.8–1.9 M for 112 days, appeared primarily in the rhizobial region under nitrate and sulfate-reducing environments and averaged nearly 61?±?14%, 52?±?12%, and 29?±?19% for acetochlor, alachlor, and rac-metolachlor, respectively.

MET enantiomeric fraction of 0.494?±?0.009 in the oxic region and 0.480?±?0.005 in the rhizobial region demonstrated that the (S)-MET was preferentially biodegraded. Chloroacetanilide ethane sulfonic acid and oxanilic acid were only observed in small quantities (0.5 nM), implying comprehensive deterioration and the procedure of previously unidentified chloroacetanilide decay routes. Hydrochemical factors and levels of oxygen were important predictors of microbial populations, while chloroacetanilide sensitivity had no discernible effect. Collectively, the outcomes emphasize the significance of chloroacetanilide anaerobic decay in wetlands and underline the possibility of supplementary chemical and biological methods for the characterization of processes involved in the environmental evaporation of chloroacetanilide (Elsayed et al., 2015).

Stereoselectivity in ecological toxicity and bioremediation of enantiomeric pesticide benalaxyl (BEN) (Fig. 3e) to aquaculture algae S. obliquus has been investigated. The h-EC(50) values were 2.893 mg L?1, 3.867 mg L?1, and 8441 mg L?1, respectively, for racemic (R)-(-)- and (S)-(?+)-BEN. Consequently, BEN stereoisomers were stereoselective in their severe toxic effects. Furthermore, various health risks have been ascertained using dyes like chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b, antioxidant enzyme activity, and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Chlorophyll a was instigated by (S)-(?+)-BEN and hindered by (R)-(-)-form at a level of 1 mg L?1. Chlorophyll b was both instigated at 1 mg L?1, but (S)-(?+)-enantiomer was four times greater than (R)-(-)-enantiomer. (S)-(?+)-BEN hindered more catalase action at 3 mg L?1 and 5 mg L?1, instigated less SOD action and malondialdehyde (MDA) composition at 5 mg L?1 than R-(-)-BEN. Evaluation of data observed on stereoselectivity during anti-oxidative stress when S. obliquus responds to BEN. In the bioremediation investigation, the half-lives of (S)-(?+)-BEN and (R)-(-)-BEN were 4.07 days and 5.04 days, respectively, resulting in comparative enhancement of (R)-(-)-enantiomer. These findings exhibited that adverse impacts and bioremediation of BEN in S. obliquus were stereoselective, and that kind of distinctions in the pesticide danger should be properly considered (Huang et al., 2012).

An HPLC technique with a chiral column to resolve the enantiomers of metalaxyl (MTX) (Fig. 3p) and furalaxyl (FUR) (Fig. 3q), and successive detection by triple quadrupole MS, was used. A Brevibacillus brevese strain demonstrated a stereoselective trend of deterioration in the culture broth and ideally the corresponding (R)-(-)-forms. Furthermore, crops augmented with both insecticides at the same composition (R)-(-)-FUR deteriorated quicker. The determination of enantiomers of FUR and MTX were obtained using isocratic elution and mobile phase containing CH3CN?+?0.1% CH3COOH?+?0.1% HCOOH and 10 mM CH3COONH4, 2-propanol (59:40:1, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 0.8 mL min?1. The chiral column functioned in a column oven at 26 °C. The recovery for all analytes (n?=?6) in liquid media was 97.5%. Quantitative estimation of enantiomers was carried out by employing the peak areas ratio of the test analytes and 13C-MTX as internal standard. It was needed as LC–MS quantification matrices could lead to an increase in the signal or signal deletion. All calibration graphs from LOQ to 5 mg L?1 levels were linear (R2?>?0.99) (Sulimma et al., 2013). Table 1 provides an overview of chiral pesticide detection and phytoremediation.

Bauer and colleagues worked on developing an effective approach for identifying pesticide metabolites (Bauer et al., 2018). In a prototype strategy, the bioactive components thiacloprid (pesticidal neonicotinoid), azoxystrobin (a fungicidal strobilurinemethoxyacrylate), and difenoconazole were applied to two Brassica species, pakchoi (B. Rapa ssp. Chinensis) and broccoli (B. oleracea var. Italica), which differ in morphological features (a triazole fungicide). Pesticide dispersion in various plant tissues and also their disintegration and bioremediation rates were investigated. In research using the Brassica plants pakchoi and broccoli, the HR-MS approach permitted the identification of pesticide metabolites. Following the kinetic investigation, the metabolite screening technique showed separate metabolite synthesis and disintegration routes of the pesticides in addition to the deterioration of the parental chemicals. During the experimentation, thiacloprid and azoxystrobin were converted to a wide range of metabolites. Furthermore, virtually all of the pesticides produced a wide range of phase I and II metabolites that may be identified using HR-MS approaches. The findings acquired from this investigation of the kind and quantity of toxic metabolites in the three pesticides give useful and fresh insights into the existence and dispersion of their leftovers and associated substances in pakchoi and broccoli from pre-harvest periods to harv",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Abstract
Insect declines have become pronounced in prairie ecosystems, particularly in areas of agricultural intensification. Non-target pesticide exposure has been raised as a key concern for prairie remnant health. Over seven years, we screened grass and soil samples for the presence and quantities of hundreds of pesticides from five prairies in Minnesota and South Dakota that are designated as Critical Habitat for two globally endangered butterflies: Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper. We documented dozens of pesticides across all sites and years on their larval host grasses. Interiors of prairies were not less likely to have detectable pesticides than along prairie-agriculture edges. Broad-spectrum organophosphate and pyrethroid insecticides were common in late season. Chlorpyrifos quantities were higher at sites where both endangered species have been extirpated. Neonicotinoid insecticides, which have been frequently attributed to declines in insect pollinators, did not present a significant exposure signal in these prairie habitats. Few pesticides were detected in soil or early season grass samples. The prevalence and quantities of pesticides we observed are likely underestimates, and additional research is needed on the landscape of risk at small and large scales. Implications for Conservation: Protected prairies are not immune to the risk of pesticide exposure, which may impact efforts to re-establish lost populations of imperiled prairie insects, including endangered butterflies.

Introduction
Declines in insect populations have received significant attention (Wepprich et al. 2019; Wagner 2020; Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhuys 2021), but deciphering their scope and causal factors is complicated (Didham et al. 2020). Such declines appear to be especially pronounced in remnant grassland ecosystems, particularly in areas of high agricultural intensification (Swengel and Swengel 2015; Habel et al. 2019; Seibold et al. 2019; Raven and Wagner 2021). The increasingly fractured remnants of North America’s endangered tallgrass prairies (Samson and Knopf 1996; Ricketts et al. 1999; Lark et al. 2019) are under stressors from many factors, including invasive species, incompatible management schemes, isolation, and climate change. However, perhaps more than any other factor, non-target exposure to agricultural pesticides has been suggested as a key driver in the declines of grassland dependent species (Mineau et al. 2005; Gibbs et al. 2009; Gibbons et al. 2015; Forister et al. 2016; Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhuys 2019).

Two historically widespread butterflies endemic to central North American prairies, the Poweshiek skipperling (Oarisma poweshiek Parker: Hesperiidae) and Dakota skipper (Hesperia dacotae Skinner: Hesperiidae), have declined dramatically in recent decades (Royer and Marrone 1992a, b; Swengel et al. 2011). The Poweshiek skipperling, extirpated from >?99% of its historic known locations (Belitz et al. 2018), is listed as Endangered in the United States (US Fish and Wildlife Service 2014) and Canada (COSEWIC 2014a) and Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List (Royer 2020), ranking among the most imperiled species in the world. Similarly, the Dakota skipper has been extirpated from at least 76% of all historic locations, and is now categorized as Threatened in the United States (US Fish and Wildlife Service 2014), Endangered in Canada (COSEWIC 2014b), and globally Endangered by the IUCN (Royer 2019).

The widespread extirpation of these and other prairie dependent butterflies coincides with large-scale changes in applications of several agricultural insecticides in the north-central United States during the mid-2000s. Of particular note is the essentially concurrent (1) introduction of the new class of neonicotinoid insecticides, which are now nearly universally applied as a seed coat to corn, and (2) invasion of the economically damaging soybean aphid (Aphis glycines Matsumura) in 2000 (Ragsdale et al. 2011) against which the broad spectrum organophosphate (particularly chlorpyrifos) and pyrethroid insecticides became the primary means of control in the early 2000s. These two classes of pesticides produce different exposure routes. Neonicotinoids are generally applied proactively as systemic seed coatings and may be transported via dust during planting early in the growing season (Tapparo et al. 2012) onto non-target plants or incorporated into soils or waters (Main et al. 2014, 2015; Hladik et al. 2014; Jones et al. 2014; Bonmatin et al. 2015; Williams and Sweetman 2019). Neonicotinoids are now the world’s most widely applied class of insecticides and have been widely posited as a primary driver of declines of butterflies, other pollinators, and indeed broad swaths of wildlife (Mason et al. 2013; Goulson 2013; Fairbrother et al. 2014; Gibbons et al. 2015; Pecenka and Lundgren 2015; Gilburn et al. 2015; Forister et al. 2016; Basley and Goulson 2018; Olaya-Arenas and Kaplan 2019). Conversely, organophosphates and pyrethroids are contact insecticides that are typically applied reactively later in the summer in response to pest pressures via aerial spraying and thus may be blown or absorbed into rain (Foreman et al. 2000; Mackay et al. 2014) that falls onto non-target areas.

Given the correlated declines of imperiled prairie butterflies and changes in pesticide applications, we document the presence and quantities of pesticides and their residues on putative larval host grasses of Dakota skipper and Poweshiek skipperling from prairie remnants formally designated as Critical Habitat for them in Minnesota and South Dakota between 2014 and 2020. We sought to assess how their composition and quantities varied across these sites and across years, if their occurrence and quantities would be lower within prairie interiors than along associated agricultural margins, how pesticide prevalence related to population and extirpation status, and how this composition might affect conservation practices.

Methods
Sample collections
We collected samples from four prairie remnants (“Sites”) in Minnesota (“Clay”, “Pope”, “Lincoln”, and “Pipestone”) and one in South Dakota (“Day”) (Fig. 1). All of the Minnesota sites are designated as Critical Habitat for both Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper (US Fish and Wildlife Service 2015). Dakota skipper remains extant at two of the sites (Day and Clay) but is extirpated from the remaining three (Pope, Pipestone, and Lincoln). Poweshiek skipperling historically occurred at all sites but is now extirpated from the region. These sites are also home to other species of conservation concern, including regal fritillary (Argynnis idalia Drury: Nymphalidae). The exact site names and specific GPS locations of sample points are censored here due to the presence of federally protected species at some sites.

From 2014 to 2020, we collected samples from between two to nine points per prairie site. Using aerial imagery in a GIS, we partitioned each prairie into 10?×?10 m grid cells, and classified cell Locations as either “edge” (within 10 m of an agricultural field) or “interior” (??100 m from any edge). We then used a random number generator to select interior and edge cell coordinates for sampling. Given our interest in understanding the potential exposure to federally protected butterflies and the high-quality prairies they depend upon, we eliminated randomly selected interior locations that did not comprise suitable habitat. Fewer edge samples were collected in some years due to budgetary constraints.

Within each selected cell, we clipped?>?5 g from a single, randomly selected little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium (Michx.) Nash: Poaceae) or clipped from a cluster of immediately adjacent little bluestems if biomass on the initially selected plant was low. If little bluestem was not available in sufficient quantities within a grid cell, we instead sampled from big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii Vitman). These grasses are indicative of intact native prairies and are among the host plants for Poweshiek skipperling, Dakota skipper, and other imperiled prairie skippers (Dana 1991; Royer et al. 2008; Rigney 2013; Seidle et al. 2018; Nordmeyer et al. 2021; Henault and Westwood 2022). We also collected paired?>?25 g of soil beneath subsets of grass samples in 2014, 2015, and 2016, sieving the soil through a 1.27 mm mesh to homogenize particulate sizes for analysis. We cleaned collection supplies (scissors, collection bowl, hand shovel, mesh sieve) with 100% acetone in the field between samples. Clean nitrile gloves were changed between each sample collection. All samples were double-bagged in 1 quart plastic zip-loc bags, immediately placed on dry ice in the field, and then transferred to a -20oC freezer at the Minnesota Zoo until overnight shipment to the laboratory for analysis.

Sampling occurred in two seasons: (1) shortly after the planting season in early June 2015 and mid-May 2016, and (2) late summer from mid-August to early September in 2014 through 2020. Samples were generally collected on one date within each season for each site. These sampling periods were selected to coincide with the likelihood for the applications of different classes of pesticides. Of particular interest were the potential occurrence of neonicotinoid insecticides early in the season following seed-coated crop plantings, and the later summer aerial applications of broad-spectrum insecticides targeting soybean aphid and other agricultural pests. Due to high per sample testing cost and minimal detections in early season samples (see below), we elected not to continue early season sampling after 2016. Sites generally were sampled without information on when or where spraying may have occurred relative to sampling. However, we had the opportunity for a single time series sample collection when an airplane-applied spray event was observed adjacent to the Pipestone site within an hour of the cessation of the collection of the first set of samples in 2014. A second set of samples was then collected the following day from many of the same cells to quantify “Before” and “After” changes in pesticides levels.

Pesticides screening
Samples were screened for pesticide residues at the U.S. Department of Agriculture Agricultural Marketing Service’s National Sciences Laboratories (“NSL”; Gastonia, NC) using the QuEChERS extraction method (AOAC 2007.01; Anastassiades et al. 2003). The NSL performed all extractions from the provided substrates (either grass or soil) and then conducted Liquid Chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to determine the quantities of pesticides and some of their residues in the samples in reference to certified analyte standards for each compound. The NSL conducted all independent quality assurance and quality control standards and re-analyzed some samples as needed to satisfy control standards.

The identities, quantities, and minimum Levels of Detection (LOD) of a total of 233 pesticides and their residues were reported for each sample, with some variation in the number of analytes between years (2014 and 2015: 174; 2016: 178; 2017 and 2018: 199; 2019 and 2020: 193) (Appendix 1). LODs varied across compounds but were internally consistent for all samples within a year. Individual compounds within a sample were reported as either (1) “Not Detected” (i.e., below their LOD), (2) “Trace” (above their LOD but lower than a level that could be quantified), or (3) quantified on a parts per billion (ppb) basis (i.e. ng/g of homogenized sample material). We treated chemicals categorized as “Not Detected” as zeroes and considered a compound to be “Present” in a sample if it was either reported as “Trace” or if amounts could be specifically quantified. Extraction protocols and some instrumentation at the NSL were upgraded between the 2016 and 2017 samples, resulting in generally lower LODs and some additional analyzed pesticides, so 2017–2020 data are likely to be more quantitatively robust. We prepared and submitted blind replicates of four samples in 2014 (Appendix 2: Su8, Su10, Su135, Su127) to verify consistency; all replicate samples varied in observed quantities only slightly.

Temporal and spatial variation
We summarize descriptive information about variation in pesticide occurrence, composition, and quantities between seasons (early vs. late) and substrates (grass vs. soil). We also tested how the number of insecticide types and the quantities of some of these insecticides varied in late season grass samples across sites and years, and if the high-quality habitat interior locations of those prairie sites had lower insecticide occurrences and quantities than locations along prairie-agricultural edges. We excluded herbicides and fungicides from these statistical tests given (1) the relative rarity of herbicides in late season samples, and (2) the technical differences in fungicide detection between the 2014–2016 and 2017–2020 samples.

We tested the ability of the fixed effects of sites, years, and location nested within site, as well as the interaction between site and year, to explain variation in the number of detected insecticides on grasses in late summer with an Analysis of Deviance specifying a Poisson distribution in R using the glm package (R Core Team 2023; Bates et al. 2015). We similarly tested how the quantities (ppb) of chlorpyrifos and cyhalothrin on late season grasses differed with these same main effects and interactions with lm Analysis of Variance in R. Other compounds were too rarely documented to facilitate analyses. For these quantity analyses, we included data from after the known 2014 Pipestone spray event (test significance did not change if the pre-spray data were instead included). Since LOD is always less than or equal to the Level of Quantification (LOQ), we estimated the ppb for trace samples to be equal to the associated LOD. We truncated the dataset for the chlorpyrifos and cyhalothrin quantity tests to include only those points where these insecticides were detected to avoid overdispersion. The remaining quantities were log10 transformed for analysis to improve normality. We also excluded from the chlorpyrifos quantity analysis a single sample (Su86; 2290 ppb, Appendix 2) from Pope in 2017 that was highly leveraged even following log transformation; significance values were similar with and without this datapoint. We tested for statistically significant groups between the main effects of site and year for all analyses using post hoc Tukey tests.

Results
We detected eight insecticides, three herbicides, 10 fungicides, and three other compounds from 226 samples, across all years, seasons, sites, and substrates. All data are presented in Appendices 2 (late season grass samples), 3 (early season grass samples), and 4 (paired soil samples), and summarized graphically in Fig. 2. Pesticides were prevalent on grasses, particularly in late season, but were rare in the paired soil samples (only 5 of 46 samples). Soil samples were significantly less likely to have at least one detectable pesticide than their paired grass samples (?21,92?=?21.45, p?<?.0001). This was true for both early season (?21,60?=?9.93, p?=?.0016) and late season (?21,32?=?12.70, p?=?.0004) sampling periods. Four pesticides (chlorpyrifos, clothianidin, atrazine, and tebuconazole) were detected in the soil samples. Notably, these single samples of clothianidin and tebuconazole are the only detections of these pesticides in the entire dataset.

Pesticides were prevalent on grasses in late season but rare in the early season. Spanning seven insecticides, three herbicides, and nine fungicides, 121 of 142 samples of the August and September grass samples from 2014 to 2020 contained at least one pesticide. In contrast, only a single pesticide (the herbicide atrazine) was detected grass samples in 21 of 38 samples during the two early season periods in May 2015 and June 2016.

Late season grass insecticides
Chlorpyrifos was by far the most frequently detected pesticide in the entire dataset, in 108 of the 142 (76.1%) late season grass samples. This organophosphate insecticide was detected in every year of the study and in every sample from 2018 to 2020. Most chlorpyrifos quantities ranged between 1 and 50 ppb (78 of the 88 quantifiable samples; global average: 49.9 ppb, median: 11.6), but a single sample contained of 2290 ppb (Appendix 2). Two other insecticides, cyhalothrin and bifenthrin, were each present in about a quarter of all late season samples (27.5% and 23.9%, respectively). The four other late summer insecticides (carbofuran, cypermethrin, diflubenzuron, esfenvalerate) were generally rare. Notably, all usage tolerances of carbofuran were revoked in the United States in 2009 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2009), so the four observations at Pope in 2017 represent a prohibited application(s).

Late season fungicides
At least one of the 10 fungicides was detected in 64 of the 142 late season grass samples. Azoxystrobin was the most frequent, in 46 samples. Notably, however, all fungicide-positive samples were collected from 2017 to 2020 (n?=?75), while fungicides were not detected in any of the late season samples (n?=?67) from 2014 to 2016. As noted above, this temporal variation is likely due to upgrades in extraction and analysis protocols at the NSL. Thus, the fungicide data from the 2017–2020 samples are more likely representative of annual deposition patterns than the 2014–2016 data.

Late season herbicides
Herbicides were rare on grasses in late summer, with generally only Trace detections of atrazine, hexazinone, and metolachor. Most summer herbicide detections were in 2019, which was an extremely wet year that likely prompted additional or later herbicide applications within and adjacent to agricultural fields.

Other compounds
Three compounds were detected for which there are no known local agricultural applications: diphenylamine, thymol, and DEET. Diphenylamine was nearly ubiquitous in Trace or low quantities (1–22 ppb) in 2017 and 2020, but there is no apparent regional agricultural usage, and no diphenylamine was sold in Minnesota in any year for which there is documentation (2018–2020) (Minnesota Department of Agriculture https://www.mda.state.mn.us/agricultural-pesticide-sales-use-reports-statewide/). Thymol was found in a single sample at Pope in 2017. Typically used as a miticide within European honey bee (Aphis mellifera Linneaus: Apidae) hives and as an animal repellent, thymol is also a naturally occurring compound in some native plants (such as Monarda fistulosa Linnaeus: Lamiaceae). DEET was detected in three samples. Applied to clothing or skin as an insect deterrent, this compound was never used by the researchers that collected our samples in the field, so the detections are likely the result of other people who had applied DEET and coincidentally walked through our sampling locations.

Before and after a known spray
Immediately following completion of sampling at Pipestone on August 19, 2014, an airplane was observed spraying a soybean field?~?350 m northwest of the nearest previously sampled point. Light northwest prevailing winds during and immediately following the late afternoon spray at the nearest weather station (Pipestone, MN; ~19 km SW of the Pipestone site; https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/) would be expected to blow aerosolized droplets containing pesticides from the spray in the direction of the Pipestone site and the previously sampled points (Su1-Su7, Appendix 2). Before and after the spray, only the three primary insecticides applied against soybean aphids (chlorpyrifos, bifenthrin, and cyhalothrin) were detected across the Pipestone site. Chlorpyrifos and cyhalothrin quantities always rose after the spray (Su8-Su12, Appendix 2). Mean chlorpyrifos quantities rose from 19.3 ppb (range 9.5–21.1) to 135.7 ppb (range 51.9–278.0). Similarly, mean cyhalothrin quantities rose from 4.0 ppb (range 2.7–7.2) to 24.8 ppb (range 8.4–83.3). In contrast, bifenthrin mean quantities fell from 31.3 ppb (range 8.3–74.5) to 24.8 ppb (range 9.5–68.9) the day after the spray. It therefore seems likely that the aerial spray was a mix of chlorpyrifos and cyhalothrin. The presence of bifenthrin in the samples was likely the result of a previous spray event or events.

Temporal and spatial variation
Insecticides were detected in late season at all sites, but the number of insecticide types varied across sites and years (Fig. 2). Site and Year interacted significantly, largely driven by increases in the number of observed insecticides at Day and Pope between 2014 and 2015 with contrasting concurrent declines at Pipestone and Clay (Appendix 5 A). The number of insecticides observed increased across all sites between 2016 and 2019 and then decreased 2020. Averaged across years, fewer insecticide types were found at Clay than at Pipestone and Day (Fig. 3A). Notably, the last known extant Dakota skipper population in Minnesota is at Clay. Fewer pesticides were detected in 2016 than in 2019, averaged across all sites (Fig. 3B). The number of insecticides detected along prairie-agricultural edges did not differ from the number detected within prairie interior locations, as indicated by a non-significant interaction between Site and nested Location (Table 1).

Similar to the pattern with the number of insecticide types noted above, Site and Year interacted significantly for both chlorpyrifos and cyhalothrin quantities, but in a manner that still allows for some interpretation of main effects (Table 1, Appendix 5B and 5 C). Crop types, pest loads, climatic effects, and associated pesticide application rates are not expected to be uniform within years across the large geographic extent of this study, and overall patterns of average exposure at a site across years are important. In terms of main effects, chlorpyrifos quantities varied significantly across both sites and years when present, while cyhalothrin quantities only varied across years (Fig. 4). Quantities of both compounds did not differ between prairie interiors and agricultural edge locations (as evidenced by non-significant interactions between Site and the nested Location for each compound). It is notable that in a post hoc Tukey contrast, chlorpyrifos quantities were significantly lower at the two sites that retain extant Dakota skipper populations (Day and Clay) than at those where Dakota skippers have been recently extirpated (Pope, Lincoln, and Pipestone).

Discussion
To our knowledge, this study represents the longest time series monitoring of pesticide occurrence across the upland portions of multiple prairie remnants that are of significant conservation interest. Most non-target prairie deposition studies have focused on wetland systems (ex: Donald et al. 1999; Messing et al. 2011; Belden et al. 2012; Main et al. 2015; Mimbs et al. 2016; McMurry et al. 2016; Evelsizer and Skopec 2018). Relatively few terrestrial pesticide occurrence studies have targeted specific compounds or situations (Main et al. 2020; Goebel et al. 2022; Zioga et al. 2023), with particular focus in North America on potential risks to monarchs and contamination of their host milkweeds (Pecenka and Lundgren 2015; Halsch et al. 2020; Krishnan et al. 2020; Hall et al. 2022; Grant et al. 2022).

Contrary to frequently cited concerns, we did not find a significant exposure signal from neonicotinoid insecticides, only detected in the soil of one of our spring samples, and none later in the summer. This does not indicate that neonicotinoids may not pose a seasonal risk or that they are not a risk in other prairie strata, but the exposure potential appears to be lower for the grasses and the soils in the hilly upland gravel prairies that we studied. In contrast, broad-spectrum insecticides, particularly organophosphates (chlorpyrifos) and pyrethroids (primarily cyhalothrin and bifenthrin) likely targeting soybean aphids in the second half of summer, were prevalent in their upland grass larval hosts. The landscape of soybean aphid insecticide applications is changing though due to (1) evolving resistance by soybean aphids to pyrethroids like cyhalothrin and bifenthrin with decreases in control effectiveness noted in Minnesota beginning in 2014 (Hanson et al. 2017; Koch et al. 2018; Menger et al. 2022) and (2) the revocation of all agricultural usage authorizations for chlorpyrifos in the United States in 2022 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2022). This combination of pyrethroid resistance and chlorpyrifos regulation may have at least a short-term effect of reducing insecticide exposure to non-target organisms in these prairies.

Conservation implications
The rapid decline and complete extirpation of Poweshiek skipperling from the vast majority of its historic range across Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota, and South Dakota was concurrent with changes in pesticide usage and the invasion of the soybean aphid. Sympatric Dakota skipper populations declined, and many also disappeared, shortly thereafter. These extirpation events occurred before this pesticide sampling began, so determining the exact linkage between the pesticides that we have observed, and the butterfly declines is necessarily speculative. However, it is highly noteworthy that the sites where Dakota skipper populations remain extant today had both fewer types of insecticide on average, as well as lower quantities of chlorpyrifos, than other sites where Dakota skippers have been extirpated.

Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper are univoltine with the adult flight in late June and early July. Eggs are laid in July, and 1st through 3rd instar larvae of both species feed through the end of summer until winter hibernation on a wide range of prairie graminoids, including the little bluestem primarily sampled in this study. Thus, both species are still foraging as small larvae on their grass hosts during the late season aerial spraying of broad-spectrum insecticides that we have documented. They resume feeding in spring (when they would theoretically be exposed to early season pesticides) and pupate in June. Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper may be at increased exposure risk relative to regal fritillary which, despite being another historically co-occurring prairie endemic of conservation concern, is still rather common at the same sites that we sampled but whose larvae do not feed until spring and may be thus more buffered from late season insecticide applications. Poweshiek skipperling may be even more vulnerable to environmental stressors, like pesticides exposure, than Dakota skipper and many other grass-feeding skippers because Poweshiek skipperling larvae do not construct shelters and remain higher on their host grass. While correlative, this larval foraging difference may therefore have contributed to the steeper and more dramatic disappearance of the once more common Poweshiek skipperling from the same prairies where Dakota skippers and other prairie butterflies remain.

These retrospective views of potential causes and effects can be cautiously useful, but of greater interest is understanding the current landscape of risk to advance conservation goals. Rare butterflies are not necessarily more likely to persist in protected sites than in unprotected areas (Warren 1993; Schlicht et al. 2009). While the formal U.S. designations of the sites from which we sampled as Critical Habitat for Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper do afford increased oversight protecting key features necessary for their conservation, that oversight only relates to activities that involve a federal permit, license, or funding. Critical Habitat is a tool to guide federal agency actions to fulfill their responsibilities to protect endangered species and the ecological resources upon which they depend, but the activities of private landowners are not affected if there is no federal funding or authorization “nexus”. The results of this study suggest that some degree of non-target pesticide exposure in these Critical Habitats are common, even in their interiors, and should probably be expected in prairie remnants across much of the historic known range of these protected butterflies. Efforts should be made to minimize risks when possible, basing them on the best available evidence to develop protection and recovery plans (e.g., Montgomery et al. 2009).

Unlike more vagile species (Ries and Debinski 2001), Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper are unlikely to colonize significantly dispersed prairie remnants. Lack of connectivity among remnants presents significant risks to low-dispersing prairie dependent species (Leach and Givnish 1996; Attwood et al. 2008; Koper et al. 2010; Nowicki et al. 2014; Wimberly et al. 2018; Crone and Schultz 2019). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service identifies that the re-establishment of dozens of “healthy” populations for each species via reintroductions is needed to satisfy downlisting criteria (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2021, 2022), a foundational effort that the Minnesota Zoo began initiating in 2017. A healthy population is formally defined as “one that is demographically, genetically, and physically robust and occupies large areas of high-quality remnant prairie habitat” (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2022). To be “robust”, a population must be “comprised of individuals with good body condition and with pesticide and pathogen loads that are below levels that could cause meaningful loss of reproductive capacity”. Thus, the risks associated with pesticide exposure must therefore be one of the formal factors considered when assessing locations for potential reintroductions (e.g., Delphey et al. 2017). The persistence of these low dispersal species will depend on the maintenance of large, high-quality prairies, for which pesticide load is an important metric.

Remaining questions
Gains have been made in our understanding of the prevalence and occurrence of pesticides in these remnant prairies, but three substantial questions remain about the landscape of risk at both small and large scales. First, how closely do the observed pesticide quantities and composition match their peak values at these sites? The data presented here are likely underestimates the extent of maximum exposures. With the exception of a single date, we do not know the specific timing or locations of the pesticide applications in the vicinity of the sampled prairie remnants (unlike say, Goebel et al. 2022). Pesticides like chlorpyrifos decay under natural conditions but may persist at low levels in the environment weeks after application (Kamrin 1997; Christensen et al. 2009; Das et al. 2020). Pesticide deposition is also expected to decline with distance from application location (Teske et al. 2002; Goebel et al. 2022), but chlorpyrifos and many other pesticid",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Abstract
This review delves into the mesmerizing technology of nano-agrochemicals, specifically pesticides and herbicides, and their potential to aid in the achievement of UN SDG 17, which aims to reduce hunger and poverty globally. The global market for conventional pesticides and herbicides is expected to reach USD 82.9 billion by 2027, growing 2.7% annually, with North America, Europe, and the Asia–Pacific region being the biggest markets. However, the extensive use of chemical pesticides has proven adverse effects on human health as well as the ecosystem. Therefore, the efficacy, mechanisms, and environmental impacts of conventional pesticides require sustainable alternatives for effective pest management. Undoubtedly, nano-agrochemicals have the potential to completely transform agriculture by increasing crop yields with reduced environmental contamination. The present review discusses the effectiveness and environmental impact of nanopesticides as promising strategies for sustainable agriculture. It provides a concise overview of green nano-agrochemical synthesis and agricultural applications, and the efficacy of nano-agrochemicals against pests including insects and weeds. Nano-agrochemical pesticides are investigated due to their unique size and exceptional performance advantages over conventional ones. Here, we have focused on the environmental risks and current state of nano-agrochemicals, emphasizing the need for further investigations. The review also draws the attention of agriculturists and stakeholders to the current trends of nanomaterial use in agriculture especially for reducing plant diseases and pests. A discussion of the pros and cons of nano-agrochemicals is paramount for their application in sustainable agriculture.

1. Introduction
The projected increase in the global population from 7.35 billion to 8.60 billion by the year 2030 poses significant challenges for food security planning. Crop production needs to be increased by up to 70% in order to fully meet the current crop demand [1]. The United Nations has set a goal of ending global hunger and poverty as part of its 2030 sustainable development goals (SDGs) 17 agenda. A more productive, environmentally friendly, and expansive agricultural sector is necessary to meet development goals in the face of climate change and finite resources [2]. The agricultural sector is currently confronting a wide range of challenges, including decreased crop productivity, soil nutrient deficiencies, the impact of climate change, limited water resources, declining soil fertility, organic matter decomposition in soil, crop ailments, a lack of understanding of genetically modified organisms, and insufficient workforce [3].
The enhancement of crop productivity can be achieved through the implementation of transgenic crop development and the utilization of marker-assisted breeding techniques. These advancements also exert adverse effects on the environment, soil fertility, and the ability of plants to resist viruses and pests [1,4]. On the other hand, the optimal crop yield is contingent upon the utilization of improved varieties, effective pest and disease control measures, and recommended fertilization practices. Effective pest management is a crucial determinant for cultivating robust and productive crops that can adequately sustain the growing population’s nutritional needs [5]. It is estimated that over 50% of the chemical fertilizers and pesticides utilized are lost as a result of leaching or mineralization [1,4]. In the last seven decades, traditional agriculture has been plagued by an overreliance on synthetic chemicals like pesticides to control pests, aiming to meet the food requirements of a rapidly growing population [6]. The persistence of these chemicals and the generation of toxic intermediates during their degradation have adverse impacts on both the biotic and abiotic components of the biosphere [7]. These chemical components have polluted the air, soil, water, and vegetation, bioaccumulated in the food chain, and posed a threat to the lives of non-target animals and plants; for example, chlorpyrifos is found in urban streams and is the main cause of death of aquatic organisms and fishes or invertebrates [8,9]. The use of synthetic chemicals also causes a steady decline in insect populations, damages communities of soil microorganisms, and results in an overall decline in biodiversity [9]. Additionally, negative effects on human health, including cancer, reproductive problems, and neurological disorders have been reported [10]. Weeds are a major source of biotic stress and loss of crop yield in agriculture, reducing harvests by an estimated 20–90%. Farmers often use conventional herbicides, which are highly toxic not only to plants and animals, but also to humans through breathing contaminated air, skin contact, or ingestion [11]. Consequences of conventional herbicides include reduced growth (reduced photosynthetic activity and amino acid synthesis) and reproduction (cellular division synthesis), as well as elevated mortality rates among various plant species such as macrophytes, periphyton, and phytoplankton [11,12]. All these serious environmental and health issues require a significant effort to be made to create ecofriendly and healthy solutions with the aim of augmenting food production within the constraints of limited resources. Hence, the present moment presents an opportune occasion to devise innovative approaches, such as nanotechnology, to facilitate the sustainable advancement of agriculture [1].
Nano-agrochemicals (NACs) are nanomaterials and formulations specifically designed and controlled at the nanoscale [13,14]. They can be defined as agricultural formulations in the form of nanopesticides (NPCs) which have unique properties (high aspect ratio) due to elements ranging in nanometer size (up to 100 nm) [2,3,15]. They have the potential to revolutionize agriculture through the promotion of efficient and ecofriendly NPCs with properties such as target specificity, the ability to control usage, and high surface area which allow the targeted delivery of nutrients and protection of crop yields [13,16]. The latest scientific investigations have unveiled a remarkable increase in efficiency, measuring at an impressive 31.5% higher than the established standards of conventional pesticides [17]. Therefore, NPCs overcome the limitations of conventional pesticides, i.e., limited bioavailability, vulnerability to light-induced degradation, and the harmful consequences of organic solvent pollution [13]. The benefits and prevailing factors of utilizing NPCs are succinctly outlined in Figure 1, which serves as a visual depiction of the factors associated with NPCs and their inherent advantages [18].
Plants 13 00109 g001Figure 1. Pictorial representation of factors pertaining to NPCs and the inherent advantages they offer in protecting agricultural ecosystems.
The regulations surrounding the use of pesticides are intricate. Safety standards for consumers, the environment, and people’s health are all enforced by governments and regulatory agencies. Pesticide-related businesses have to deal with issues like regulatory compliance, residues, and environmental impact [19,20]. It is estimated that pests and weeds cause a global average loss in crop yields of 35% [21]. The global market for pesticides has expanded as a result of the attempt to control pests and weeds. The modern farming market in the Asia–Pacific and Latin American regions has already reached a value of billions in USD [22]. It was estimated in 2009 that agriculture producers globally supply approximately USD 40 billion worth of pesticides annually, which are used to eliminate pest-related diseases worldwide [23]. The global use of pesticides significantly increased from 1990 to 2007, and this trend then changed after 2007 and 2014 [24]. Although there are many classes of pesticides, some internationally used ones are (1) herbicides (phenoxy hormone products, triazines, amides, carbamates herbicides, and dinitroanilines), (2) insecticides (chlorinated hydrocarbons, organo-phosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids, carbamates-insect-SdTr, and pyrethroids-SeedTr-Ins), and (3) fungicides and bactericides (dithiocarbamates, benzimidazoles, triazoles, and dialzenes) [25]. The utilization of pesticides across continents, the top 10 countries with the highest consumption of pesticides per unit area of cropland (kg/ha), and the percentage of usage for agricultural purposes from 2000 to 2021 are depicted in Figure 2 [26].

The pesticide market, encompassing herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides, yields substantial annual profits on a global scale. The projected growth of the global pesticide market is estimated to be from USD 78.16 billion in 2021 to USD 85.11 billion in 2022, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.90%. The market is expected to reach a value of USD 105.39 billion by 2026, with a CAGR of 5.5% [27]. The global market for herbicides reached a significant valuation of USD 31.50 billion in 2022 [28]. The projected growth of the market is expected to increase from USD 33.39 billion in 2023 to USD 53.21 billion by 2032 [29]. The global market share value of insecticides in 2022 was USD 19.50 billion [30]. The projected growth of the global insecticide market is estimated to be from USD 19.50 billion in 2022 to USD 20.95 billion in 2023, with a CAGR of 7.4% [27]. The global market for fungicides reached a significant valuation of USD 16.35 billion in 2019 [31]. The projected growth of the fungicide market is expected to reach USD 25.81 billion by 2028, with a CAGR of 4.3% from its previous value of USD 18.43 billion in 2021 [32]. According to an alternative estimation, the projected value of the worldwide fungicide market is anticipated to reach USD 41.9 billion by the year 2032, exhibiting a CAGR of 7.0% [33]. The primary factors driving the growth of this industry are a growing need for food to feed the world’s rapidly expanding population, constraints on the availability of arable land, and a heightened awareness of the importance of pesticide use. Additionally, pesticide companies use a variety of strategies to meet rising demand, increase competitive advantage, foster product and technological innovation, reduce production costs, and expand their customer base. The decision of farmers to abstain from the use of pesticides carries the risk of diminishing crop yield, which in turn could have adverse effects on both the food chain and the availability of agricultural goods [34].
1.1. Effectiveness of Pesticides
The efficacy of pesticides in pest control is contingent upon various factors, encompassing the particular pest species, the type of pesticide employed, the severity of the infestation, the method of application, and prevailing environmental conditions. Pesticides are specifically formulated to show toxicity towards targeted pests, encompassing a wide range of organisms such as insects, plant diseases, weeds, and other undesirable entities [9,35,36]. The choice of a pesticide ought to be contingent upon the particular circumstances at hand, with due regard for the potential ramifications on non-target organisms during the selection process. In the context of chronic pest problems, it is advisable to employ spot treatments and opt for less toxic substances that have a longer duration of efficacy. Conversely, in emergency scenarios, it may be imperative to utilize substances that have a shorter lifespan, act rapidly, and possess higher acute toxicity [35]. In controlled laboratory settings, pesticides often exhibit significant efficacy (Table 1). However, their effectiveness can be diminished in real-world scenarios due to various factors, including the presence of natural predators, fluctuations in temperature, and other environmental conditions [9,35,36]. Factors affecting the effectiveness of pesticides and their classification based on their nature and applications are summarized in Figure 3.

Table 1. Effectiveness of different chemical pesticides and herbicides in agriculture.

1.2. Ecological Risks of Pesticides
Exposure to pesticides can result in a range of negative outcomes, varying from minor skin irritation or allergic reactions to more pronounced and severe symptoms. Certain insecticides, although posing limited harm to human health, can display substantial toxicity towards beneficial insects, such as parasitic wasps and honeybees, as well as other desirable organisms like earthworms and aquatic invertebrates [9,35]. When comparing herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides, it is evident that insecticides display a greater level of toxicity towards the environment. It is important to highlight those specific herbicides that demonstrate considerably greater levels of hazards and toxicity compared to insecticides, which are primarily attributed to variances in solubility. Water-soluble compounds have the ability to be transported into groundwater, rivers, streams, and lakes, subsequently entering living organisms and persisting within the food chain [85]. The persistence of pesticide residues in groundwater is prolonged. Alachlor, atrazine, and aldicarb are frequently encountered pesticides in groundwater [86]. The careful choice of pesticides with minimal toxicity to mammals, quick biodegradation, and limited harm to non-target organisms is crucial in order to mitigate any potential adverse effects [87].
Ecologically toxic pesticides which may pollute the environment are herbicides (paraquat, glyphosate, atrazine, and 2, 4-D), insecticides (parathion, diazinon, aldicarb, and DDT) and fungicides (captan, benomyl, and copper) [88]. Herbicides can kill some beneficial plant species which provide food and shelter for wildlife species [89]. An insecticide’s potential to kill the targeted species may also affect invertebrates which are a food source for birds [86]. Due to the toxicity and extensive application of pesticides, amphibians are among the most threatened species on earth [89]; pesticides also threaten human health and aquatic environments [54,55]. With significant concerns regarding toxicity, the WHO has defined pesticide residue as any substance in the food of living organisms originating from pesticides and regarded as toxic compounds [9,10]. Long-term pesticide exposure may lead to a few types of cancer like prostate and lung, and neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s [9,10]. Consumers worldwide are progressively demanding food free of hazardous pesticide residues [9,10]. Different countries have started programs to analyze pesticide remnants in food and several countries are applying programs to reduce pesticide use to minimize their hazardous impact [90]. For example, atrazine, owing to its ease of use, affordability, effectiveness in controlling weeds, and relatively extended persistence in the environment, is frequently detected as one of the predominant herbicides in water sources. Although it is banned in many countries such as those of the European Union (since 2004) and China (since 2012), and is partially banned in Australia and Canada, it is extensively utilized in the United States and frequently detected in water sources exceeding the limit set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Exposure to atrazine in both humans and animals has been associated with cardiovascular alterations, the specific underlying cause of which remains undefined [91,92]. The effectiveness of different pesticides and their ecological risks are listed in Table 1.
1.3. Recommendations for the Application of Pesticides
There are several prospective avenues for future development which hold great promise for the creation of ecologically sustainable and efficient methods of delivering pesticides. These include the following approaches.
Precision agriculture, also known as smart farming or satellite farming, is an innovative approach that utilizes advanced technologies to optimize agricultural practices. By integrating various tools such as a combination of sensors, data analytics, and GPS technology, this system collects comprehensive data pertaining to agricultural fields. The data collected encompass crucial aspects such as soil conditions, crop health, and levels of pest infestation. The data are utilized to tailor agricultural methodologies, such as the application of pesticides, to suit the specific characteristics of individual fields. This approach provides target-specific application, mitigates environmental pollution and safeguards non-target organisms, and optimizes timing and data-driven decision making for pesticide application based on real-time data [93].
Smart delivery systems encompass pesticide application technologies that employ precise release mechanisms to administer pesticides at specific times and rates. These systems maximize the efficacy of pesticides while minimizing their impact on the environment. Microcapsules represent an intelligent and efficient method of delivering pesticides. Microcapsules, minute spherical structures, envelop pesticides within a protective layer. The gradual degradation of the coating facilitates the controlled release of the pesticide. This mechanism guarantees the controlled release of the pesticide, optimizing its efficacy while minimizing the potential for runoff or volatilization hazards. Intelligent agents exemplify a sophisticated delivery system. Intelligent agents, in the form of micro-robots, strategically deliver pesticides to targeted areas within plant tissues or soil. This technology facilitates the targeted application of pesticides, reducing the potential for unintended harm to surrounding organisms [93].
Biomimetic pesticide delivery systems are innovative approaches inspired by nature to efficiently transport pesticides. This approach seeks to enhance the efficacy, efficiency, and ecofriendliness of pesticide delivery systems. Wax-based coatings exemplify a biomimetic approach for delivering pesticides. Pheromones possess the potential to serve as a biomimetic mechanism for delivering pesticides. Pheromones are bioactive compounds secreted by organisms to facilitate inter-species communication. They lure pests towards traps or designated areas for the purpose of pesticide application. Encapsulation is a process in which pesticides are enveloped in a protective coating. Coatings can be fabricated using a variety of materials, including polymers, waxes, and hydrogels. Encapsulation serves as a protective barrier for the pesticide, enhancing its efficacy while minimizing the potential for environmental contamination [94]. The utilization of cutting-edge technologies holds great potential to enhance pest management and safeguard crop health. This practice fosters sustainable agricultural methods and contributes to the enhancement of environmental well-being.
2. Alternatives
The drawbacks of conventional pesticides which harm the environment and people’s health, as well as contribute to pest resistance, dictate the use of bio-based pesticides, NACs, and other alternatives. Researchers are now looking into alternatives that are safer and more effective at eradicating pests.
2.1. Biopesticides
Biopesticides (BPs), derived from various organic sources such as plants, animals, insects, fungi, and microorganisms, are considered to be safer and more environmentally friendly alternatives in pest control. Currently, BPs hold a 5% market share in the global pesticide industry and are used specifically for the purpose of environmentally sustainable pest management [95]. BPs are widely regarded as a potential remedy for addressing the challenges associated with conventional pesticides. The liquid-based formulation of these substances is characterized by its simplicity, making it convenient to handle. These products possess environmentally friendly characteristics, as they are biodegradable and non-toxic, and exhibit target specificity, rendering them highly effective even in small quantities [96]. The first documented evidence of the use of BPs related to the identification of mycoherbicides (fungi-based herbicides) in the middle of the 1970s. When bioherbicides were first introduced to the market in 1980, they were only used by farmers in the US, Canada, Ukraine, and Europe [97]. BPs can be classified into three primary categories.
Microbial biopesticides (MBPs) are composed of naturally present microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoans). MBPs control pests by following natural mechanisms and share many of the characteristics of pesticides. They cope with problems like insect resistance and target modification. More than 3000 microbes which infect and kill insects are available for integrated pest management. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) currently dominates approximately 90% of the MBP market. However, other organisms such as Beauveria bassiana, Baculovirus, Steinernema, Nosema, and Chlorella have also shown noteworthy contributions in this field [95]. Currently, the identification of natural enemies of insect pests remains limited, with only 15% of these organisms having been successfully recognized and documented. The primary contributors for MBPs are parasitoids belonging to the Hymenoptera order, as well as predators from the Neuroptera, Hemiptera, and Coleoptera orders. Globally, there exists a wide array of over 125 species of natural enemies that are commercially accessible for the purpose of implementing biological control programmes. Some notable examples include Trichogramma spp., Encarsia formosa Gahan, and Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot [5]. There are also some pesticides which use fungi (Aschersonia aleyrodis) and protozoa (Nosema locustae) as active ingredients [96].
Natural and synthetic substances with active ingredients that effectively manage pests through mechanisms that are not toxic to the targeted pests, the surrounding environment, or humans are collectively referred to as biochemical biopesticides (BCBPs) [95]. These substances range from essential oils and semiochemicals to plant growth regulators and insect growth regulators to secondary metabolites and natural minerals, all of which are frequently used as BCBPs [98]. These BCBPs typically exhibit a preference for particular pest species. Their composition potentially includes insect pheromones which have the ability to interfere with the mating behaviors of pests. Additionally, it may consist of botanical extracts possessing insecticidal or herbicidal characteristics, such as neem oil or pyrethrins sourced from chrysanthemum flowers [95,98,99]. The term “Plant Incorporated Protectants” (PIPs) is used to describe a wide range of plant-derived substances, both naturally occurring and genetically modified, that have the ability to control or eradicate pests. Genes for resistance to pests and diseases, such as Bt genes, chitinase, lactinase, and protease inhibitors, can be introduced into plant genomes through molecular techniques. The modified genes are expressed in these plants to produce chemicals with pesticide effects [9,10,95]. Indigenous PIPs are derived from botanicals like garlic (Allium sativum), cassia (Cinnamomum cassia), neem (Azadirachta indica), pine (Pinus), and triphala (a blend of three fruits). Proteins found in plant-based products are subject to biodegradation, a process that breaks them down into simpler building blocks. The fact that these proteins are safe for consumption by humans and animals is a major plus [10,95].
2.2. Effectiveness of Biopesticides
BPs may be less effective against a broader range of agricultural issues because they are more focused on specific pests or weeds than conventional pesticides. They are also influenced by environmental factors; these interventions necessitate precise timing and optimal application conditions [2,100,101]. They may also necessitate more frequent applications to keep problems under control, increasing labor costs and energy consumption in terms of fuel [101]. They have short shelf lives and may need to be refrigerated or frozen to remain effective. Inadequate research has been conducted on the long-term efficacy, safety, and consequences of certain biopesticides, which is a major concern. The safety and longevity of BPs are dependent on ongoing research and monitoring [2,100,101]. Their effectiveness can be influenced by the formulation and application techniques employed, as well as the particular pests being targeted. This is the reason why current R&D efforts are primarily directed towards augmenting the durability and utilization of these methods within the framework of integrated pest management (IPM) strategies [2,100]. The effectiveness against target pests and ecological risks of different biopesticides in agriculture are listed in Table 2.
2.3. Ecological Risks of Biopesticides
BPs are derived from naturally occurring sources and are widely acknowledged as being more sustainable options in comparison to conventional synthetic pesticides. However, they also pose moderate ecological risks, as they may result in adverse effects on non-target organisms such as beneficial insects, avian species, aquatic life, and other forms of wildlife [102]. They can enter the environment through a number of different pathways, including spray drift, runoff, and leaching into groundwater. Severity is dependent on type, dosage, quantity, and environmental factors [102]. The biopesticide Bacillus thuringiensis, derived from a soil-dwelling bacterium, can persist in the environment and harm non-target insects [96]. Additionally, there is a chance that pests will develop resistance to BPs, making it more difficult to control pests in the future. One such example is glufosinate resistance which has already developed [103]. Despite these risks, they are more environmentally friendly than synthetic pesticides. They can be used in IPM programs to reduce pesticide use while maintaining crop yields because they work well in small quantities, decompose quickly, and are effective. To reduce the risk to the environment from spraying, best practices can be used to minimize spray drift, runoff, and leaching [96,102,104].

3. Nano-Agrochemicals (NACs)
NACs, or nanotechnology-based agrochemicals, have gained considerable attention in recent years due to extensive research and development efforts. These cutting-edge products harness the special qualities of NPs to improve the effectiveness, safety, and ecofriendliness of conventional agrochemicals. This technology has emerged as a valuable tool in the agricultural sector, offering novel and efficient solutions for conventional agricultural methods and practices. Some of these include NPCs, among other NACs, which have the capacity to revolutionize agriculture by enhancing sustainability and efficiency [3,13,17,122]. These NPCs, ranging in size from 1 to 200 nm, serve as a vehicle to transport agrochemical ingredients (AcI) [123]. With unique properties, they outperform conventional pesticides by 31.5% [17] in managing crop pathogens, weeds, and insects [123]. These unique properties include enhanced water solubility, improved bioavailability, and increased protection of agrochemicals from environmental degradation [123]. Thus, NPCs address the drawbacks of conventional pesticides such as limited availability, susceptibility to degradation from light, and the negative effects of organic solvent pollution [13].
The research in this field focuses on enhancing green synthesis and ecofriendly methods to minimize the use of expensive and hazardous materials in the synthesis of NACs. Using plants, enzymes, and microorganisms for biogenic synthesis allows better control of the size and shape of nanomaterials. Moreover, recent developments and trends in the field of biology encompass a variety of advancements and emerging patterns in the green synthesis of NACs [3,85,124,125]. During the synthesis process, plant extracts (reducing agents) donate electrons to metal ions in metal salts and reduce them to form metals for NACs under controlled conditions such as temperature, pH, and reactant concentration [124,126]. NPs can be further modified by adding functional groups or coatings to improve their stability, solubility, or targeting ability [127]. Recent studies on biomimetic methods suggest that NPs with built-in pesticide properties can be made from silica-based materials that resemble plant cell walls [128]. Figure 4a shows the schematic green synthesis of NACs. They have the potential to revolutionize crop protection, fertilization, and environmental safety through their application as pesticides, fertilizers, plant growth regulators, soil amendments, water treatment agents, food preservatives, biocontrol agents, biosensors, drug delivery systems, and environmental remediation agents [129]. They safeguard beneficial organisms and the environment through their specifically targeted action [3]. Thematic applications of nano-agrochemicals that improved synthetic pesticide efficacy are shown in Figure 4b. The effectiveness of various nano-agrochemicals in agriculture is discussed in Table 3.

3.1. Types of Nanopesticides (NPCs)
NACs (such as NPCs) represent a remarkable advancement in contemporary agricultural practices. Nanostructures are used as carriers for agrochemical AIs [123]. The utilization of nanotechnology in agrochemicals effectively addresses the limitations associated with traditional agrochemicals, such as limited bioavailability, susceptibility to photolysis, and the potential for organic solvent pollution [13]. Researchers have conducted an extensive analysis of a large dataset consisting of 36,658 patents and 500 peer-reviewed journal articles, resulting in the identification of two prominent categories of NPCs. Type 1 NPCs consist of metals such as Ag, Cu, and Ti, while Type 2 NPCs involve the utilization of nanocarriers to encapsulate the AIs. These nanocarriers can be composed of various materials such as polymers, clays, and zein nanoparticles (NPs) [17].
3.1.1. Type 1: Metal-Based Nanopesticides (m-NPCs)
The m-NPCs use metallic nanoparticles as active ingredients, providing numerous advantages compared to conventional chemical pesticides [130]. They are smaller, usually between a few and 200 nm [17,131]. The presence of multiple active sites for the release of bioactive molecules, ion-exchanging properties, high adsorption ability, efficient surface chemistry, high thermo-stability, and exceptional electronic characteristics in nanotechnology have led to the development of m-NPCs [131,132]. In general, metal formulations are synthesized using metal clusters or ions as nucleation centers which are interconnected by organic ligands. Metal-based encapsulation exhibits advantageous properties such as high surface/volume ratio, voluminous pores, adjustable pore size, efficient surface chemistry, high thermo-stability, and multiple topologies [131]. These NPCs are effective against a wide range of pests and diseases, but they also have the potential to be toxic to non-target organisms. Recent studies have demonstrated that their utilization shows superior efficacy compared to their non-nanoscale analogues. This advancement has proven to be involved in augmenting agricultural productivity, ensuring the safety of food products, and enhancing their nutritional content [17]. m-NPCs can act as pesticides by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS), releasing cations, damaging biomolecules, depleting ATP, and interacting with membranes [133]. A range of metallic and metallic oxide NPs have shown promising sustainable agriculture and antimicrobial applications in vitro against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria.

"ABSTRACT
Clinical relevance
Pupil size evaluation using clinical examination may be important for detecting and monitoring individuals at risk of neurotoxic effects from chemical exposure, as it may enable early intervention and the implementation of preventive measures.

Background
This work aimed to investigate the association between pesticide exposure and pupil size. Pupil size is regulated by muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, and it is well-established that common pesticide chemicals disrupt this regulation.

Methods
Twenty agricultural workers exposed to pesticides, and twenty participants not exposed, underwent visual screening, and pupil size evaluation under mesopic and photopic conditions. Additionally, signs of neurotoxicity and pesticide exposure in both groups were evaluated using the modified version of the neurotoxic symptoms questionnaire (Q16) and measuring cholinesterase (AChE) levels in blood, respectively.

Results
Agricultural workers exposed to pesticides had a score indicating medium–high level of neurotoxicity (49.85 (SD?±?8.94)) which was significantly higher (t (36)?=?7.659, p???0.0001) than non-exposed participants who had low levels of neurotoxicity (27.25 SD?±?8.86). There was a significant difference in pupil size (mm) under mesopic (t (19) 4.42 p?=?0.003) and scotopic (t (19) 4.63, p?=?0.0002) conditions between the two groups. Additionally, there was a significant difference in AChE blood levels (t (19) 2.94 p?=?0.008) between exposed and non-exposed participants, indicating that exposed workers had low levels of this enzyme (average exposed group 3381?U/L (SD?±?1306)) compared to the non-exposed group (average non-exposed group 4765?U/L (SD?±?1300)). A significant negative correlation between AChE levels, years of exposure, and pupil size was found. The latter finding importantly showed that smaller pupils are associated with the accumulation of acetylcholine or a decrease in the activity of the enzyme AChE.

Conclusion
Pupil size of agricultural workers exposed to pesticides can be abnormal and is associated with neurotoxicity as indicated by symptomatology and cholinesterase levels. Evaluation of pupil size may be useful for clinically detecting neurotoxicity.

Introduction
Pesticides are chemical substances used to prevent, destroy, or control plant and animal pests. They can be classified according to their chemical family (organochlorines, organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids, dipyridyl compounds, and inorganic salts).Citation1 Pesticides can cause toxicity and harm in humans if the level of exposure is sufficiently high.Citation2,Citation3 It has been estimated that annually there are 385 million cases of unintentional, acute pesticide poisoning worldwide, including around 11,000 fatalities.Citation4

Agricultural populations exposed to pesticides have been reported to suffer various health problems, mainly neurological disorders, and respiratory, reproductive, endocrinological, and dermal problems.Citation5–7 For example, organophosphorus compounds inhibit enzymes like acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and neuropathy target esterase (NTE)Citation8,Citation9; this results in the accumulation of acetylcholine (ACh) and phosphatidylcholine, respectively which may lead to acute or intermediate poisoning due to the cholinergic effect and organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP).Citation9,Citation10

The main manifestations of acute intoxication are excessive overstimulation of muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic receptors, which can lead to changes in consciousness, muscle weakness, and excessive secretory activity.Citation11,Citation12 In addition, organophosphate and carbamate exposure is associated with neurodegenerative diseases.Citation13–15

Given the wide range of pesticide exposure on physiological and cognitive functions,Citation16,Citation17 one possible sensitive diagnostic test to quantify the signs and symptoms of neurotoxicity, is the evaluation of vision and visual function, which previous studies have shown to be highly susceptible to neurotoxic damage.Citation18–20 A candidate measure is the pupil size,Citation21–23 which has experimentally shown reversible changes due to exposure to organophosphorus.Citation24–26 Importantly, changes in pupil size have occurred without other overt signs of toxicity and suggest that miosis may be an early sign of pesticide exposure.Citation22,Citation27

Pupillary miosis is the function of the sphincter of the pupil, which is innervated by parasympathetic fibres. At the same time, mydriasis is the function of the dilator pupillae and is controlled by sympathetic fibres.Citation22,Citation28 In this way, the pupil size reflects the function of the autonomic nervous system, which regulates the antagonistic actions of the iris sphincter and the dilator muscles of the eye and controls the amount of light entering the eye.Citation29

Synaptic transmission in the neural pathways regulating pupil size involves AChE, which, as mentioned, is inhibited by pesticide-related organophosphates.Citation8 Organophosphates in the eye can cause significant AChE inhibition and muscarinic receptor downregulation which may lead to abnormal presentations of pupil size, particularly miosis.Citation27,Citation30 Indeed, most visual and ocular signs and symptoms of acute organophosphate poisoning are reflected in different types of muscarinic manifestations (generally the parasympathetic system), such as pupillary contraction (miosis), stimulation of the different endings of the lacrimal gland and blurred vision (due to accommodation).Citation30 The miotic effect may be reduced after repeated exposure to organophosphates because of the development of tolerance to cholinergic agonists and desensitisation of muscarinic AChE receptors on the pupillary sphincter.Citation31

Accordingly, miosis may be a potential marker for pesticide agents in the body.Citation22,Citation27 Given the strong action of the pesticide on the neuronal system that supports miosis, the assessment of pupil size in individuals exposed to pesticides may provide a sensitive and efficient indication of neurotoxicity, as its measurement is non-invasive fast and easy to perform.

The present study aimed to establish whether exposure to occupational levels of pesticides in agricultural workers is associated with altered pupil sizes, particularly signs of miosis. In addition, pupil size with neurotoxic symptoms (using a modified version of the Neurotoxic Symptoms Q16 questionnaire) was associated with the level of blood AChE activity which is a commonly used indicator of pesticide exposure.Citation32

Recent research (conducted on farm workers) has shown that regular exposure to pesticides can lead to neurotoxicity resulting in deficits in visual function, particularly in contrast and colour perception, and elevated inflammatory markers (Substance p) in tears.Citation33 This finding suggests that measuring changes in vision may be a useful way of quantifying the impact on the brain. The present study seeks to add to this understanding and by investigating the relationship between neurotoxicity and pupil size in workers exposed to occupational levels of pesticides.

Methods
This research followed the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki for medical research in human beings. Each participant was informed of the benefits and risks of the study and a written informed consent was signed. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Health Sciences of the University of La Salle (Memorandum 029 17,042,017).

An observational cross-sectional analytical study was conducted to quantify the pupil size in agricultural workers exposed to pesticides, their relationship with neurotoxic symptoms, and blood cholinesterase levels. These results were compared to non-agricultural workers not exposed to pesticides. There were 38 participants in the present study. The non-exposed group comprised 20 subjects (8 women and 12 men) with a mean age of 27?years (SD?±?7.05), and the exposed group was 18 male subjects with a mean age of 31 (SD?±?5.68).

Agricultural workers in the exposed group were selected from potato farms that used pesticides such as organophosphates (OPs), carbamates (CAs), pyrethroids (PIs): Bifenthrin (2-methylbiphenyl-3-ylmethyl(1RS,3RS)-3-[(Z)-2-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoroprop-1-enyl]-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate), Profenofos (O-4-bromo-2-chlorophenyl O-ethyl S-propyl phosphorothioate), cypermethrin ((RS)-a-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl (1RS,3RS;1RS,3SR)-3-(2,2-dichloro vinyl)-2,2- dimethyl cyclopropane carboxylate) and Carbosulfan (2,3-dihydro-2,2-dimethylbenzofuran-7-yl (dibutylaminothio) methylcarbamate).

Potato farms in Colombia use between 1.0 and 2.5?kg/ha of pesticides annually. Over 4 weeks, the type and frequency of use of pesticides by applicators and operators collaborating on farms who participated in the present study were: OPs: 22 times; PIs: 16 times; CAs: 22 times. The population under study was located geographically in the municipality of Belén, Boyacá, aged between 20 and 40?years, and worked as farmers for at least one year. The average number of years of exposure was 12.6 (SD?±?5.10) and ranged from 4 to 22?years.

Participants of the same age group who were not exposed to occupational levels of pesticides comprised the non-exposed group. The sample size used in the present study was estimated with a power of 80% and a type I error of 5%, based on two previous studies and assuming an effect size of 0.61 (Glass’s Delta). This effect size was derived from previously reportedCitation18,Citation34 means and standard deviations of the neurotoxic symptoms questionnaire (Q16) scores for participants exposed and not exposed to pesticides.

The exclusion criteria for both groups were those who reported an alteration or were previously diagnosed with alterations in the pupillary response and neurobehavioral deficiencies, systemic diseases, macular diseases, and opacities in the cornea and/or lens. Another exclusion criterion for the non-exposed group was living with someone who worked or was exposed to pesticides. The inclusion criteria for the non-exposed group were individuals who had never worked or were exposed for long periods to any pesticide or suffered from any disease related to changes in pupil size.

The neurotoxic symptoms questionnaire Q16 is commonly used to monitor the early effects of neurotoxic exposures in the working population and has been internationally recognised as the gold standard test for the detection of neurotoxic symptoms by the World Health Organization.Citation35 This questionnaire has been modified and validated,Citation36 to be used in different studies for screening of neurotoxicity due to exposure to organic solvents and their impacts on vision.Citation18,Citation33,Citation34

The questionnaire contained 16 short questions about the symptoms commonly described by workers exposed to solvents, such as: ‘I have a short memory’, Sometimes I have a painful tingling sensation in some part of my body”, or ‘I feel that I have less sensitivity or a complete loss of sensation in some parts of the arms or legs’. These questions are evaluated using a 5-level Likert scale ranging from totally disagree (1) to agree (5). Once the subject completed the questionnaire, the total sum of the scores is used to indicate the level of neurotoxicity, which can be categorised as Low (16–32), Medium-low (33–48), Medium high (49–64) and high (65–80).

Instrumentation and procedures
An optometric examination includes a battery of tests such as visual acuity assessment, anterior segment examination, direct ophthalmoscopy (for retinal fundus assessment), refraction test, and evaluation of the pupils. All tests were assessed binocularly, under standardised conditions, and by the same examiner. Participants were first visually screened, including a comprehensive anamnesis and distance and near visual acuity assessment using the Good-Lite ETDRS and for near vision and near visual chart, respectively. After examination, participants who displayed abnormalities in vision were excluded from the study. All participants filled out a baseline survey that included questions related to alcohol consumption, smoking, medications, metabolic diseases, or neurological diseases.

Biomicroscopy was assessed using the Ezer Slit lamp®, while direct ophthalmoscopy and retinoscopy were assessed using the Welch Allyn® diagnostic kit. Participants who required refractive correction were corrected at that time with a frame trial and lenses, this frame was used during the examination to take the different visual tests, and at the end, the final optical prescription was given to each participant.

After the visual screening, pupil size was assessed with the Autorefractor keratometer (Huvitz Wavefront Ref/Keratometer HRK ?7000, version 5.02.00A made in Korea). This system comprises various features that provide measurements, including the pupillary diameter. To measure the pupil diameter, the subject was asked to observe the target without trying to make any visual effort to see the image but rather to be completely relaxed, and three measurements for each eye were obtained to provide an estimate of the average pupil size of each eye. This procedure was performed under mesopic and scotopic targets (0.80 lux for mesopic and 0.08 lux for scotopic) as these were the measurement conditions of the device. The distance between the corneal apex of the subject and the equipment was 40?mm.

The level of AChE in blood was measured by taking a venous blood sample from participants at the same visit. This sample was centrifugated (1200?rpm x 10?min), and the serum was separated. The serum was transported to a laboratory in an ice chamber at a temperature between 6.8°C and 7.4°C, and the kinetic method was used at 405?nm to determine the amount of cholinesterase in the serum. The Wiener lab® brand kit and procedure Fixed ?T was used. Reagent A was reconstituted with 3?ml of reagent B and pre-incubated for 1 min at 25°C, 20?µl of the sample was added and mixed and immediately the absorbance at 405?nm was recorded, and immediately the stopwatch was triggered, it was reread at 30, 60 and 90 s. The average difference was determined every 30 according to ?A/30) by subtracting the reading from the previous one and averaging the values. This was repeated with each of the samples. The reference values established by the Wiener lab® laboratory for the kit used and the temperature used are 3200–9000?U/L.

Statistical analysis
The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to verify that the data was normally distributed. Depending on the type of data and comparison between groups or conditions, either a t-test or Mann–Whitney test was used. A two-way ANOVA with post hoc comparison (Tukey’s test, corrected for multiple comparisons) was also performed to establish whether pupil size was significantly different between exposed and non-exposed individuals for different lighting conditions. Correlation analysis between two variables was assessed using Spearman’s Rho. In all cases, a p?<?0.05 value was considered statistically significant. The analysis was conducted with the Graph Pad software, version 9.

Results
Indicators of neurotoxicity and pesticide exposure
There was a statistically significant difference between non-exposed and exposed groups for AChE activity (t (36) 2.99, p?=?0.008). In particular, the group of exposed workers had lower activity of AChE 3381?U/L SD?±?1306?U/L than the non-exposed group 4765?U/L SD?±?1300?U/L. Cohen’s d, was 1.06, indicating a moderate to large effect size. Modified Q16 neurotoxic symptoms questionnaire scores were also significantly different between the two groups (t (36)?=?7.659, p???0.0001), with the exposed group reporting on average higher symptom scores of 49.85 SD?±?8.94 (which indicated medium-high neurotoxicity levels) than the non-exposed group 27.25 SD?±?8.86. The average duration of exposure was 12.6?years (SD?±?5.10). Cohen’s d, was 2.53, indicating a large effect size.

There was no correlation between the modified neurotoxic symptoms questionnaire Q16 score and years of exposure (rho?=?0.10 (p?=?0.65)) for the exposed group (see Table 1). However, modified Q16 neurotoxic symptoms questionnaire scores were negatively correlated with AChE activity in bloodrho?=??0.56 (p?=?0.0009) for the exposed group but not for the non-exposed group p?=?0.39. This result suggests that higher neurotoxicity symptoms may be associated with lower AChE activity (see discussion) in individuals exposed to pesticides.Citation8,Citation32

The average pupil size for the exposed group for mesopic and scotopic light levels was smaller than the non-exposed group (Figure 1). The Shapiro–Wilk normality test showed that all pupil size data were normally distributed. A two-way ANOVA was conducted with Lighting Conditions (mesopic and scotopic) and Group (non-exposed and exposed) as factors. This analysis showed a significant effect of Lighting Condition (F (3, 57)?=?43.50, p?=?0.0136, ?2?=?0.69) with pupil size on average larger under scotopic than mesopic conditions. A main effect of Group was also observed, with pupil sizes on average smaller for the exposed group than the non-exposed group (F (19, 55)?=?2.152, p?=?<0.0001, ?2?=?0.42). There was no significant interaction effect.

Significant correlations were observed between AChE activity and pupil size for mesopic (rho?=?0.589, p?=?0.010) and scotopic conditions (rho?=?0.504, p?=?0.033), such that lower AChE activity is associated with smaller pupil sizes.

Discussion
The present study quantified the relationship between pesticide exposure and pupil size and associated pupil size with neurotoxic symptoms (as measured by the modified Q16) and AChE in blood. Exposure to pesticides was associated with significant alterations in pupil size, which was significantly smaller (in both mesopic and scotopic conditions) for the exposed group compared to the non-exposed group.

The exposed group, on average, reported significantly more neurotoxic symptoms and lower levels of AChE in blood, indicating overstimulation of the nervous system that manifests in a spectrum of neurotoxic symptoms, several of which are assessed using the modified Q16 questionnaire. These symptoms associated with AChE inhibition encompass involuntary muscle twitching and weakness (Questions 11–15), cognitive impairment, including confusion or other neurological deficits (Questions 1–8), and in severe cases, organ failure, particularly respiratory failure (Question 10).

Pesticides inhibit AChE levels which can impact nicotinic and muscarinic processes, including pupil size.Citation11 As reported in the present study, the exposed group had smaller pupil size, and this may occur due to the accumulation of ACh at nerve synapses due to the inhibition of the AChE enzyme. The excessive amounts of ACh produced result in symptoms or signs of cholinergic poisoning.Citation9,Citation11 Previous studies on the effects of these chemical compounds on the eye suggest that the inhibition of AChE is a direct result of the vapours on ocular tissues rather than systemic absorption and distribution of the pesticide.Citation19,Citation24,Citation31

The localised increase in ACh leads to the contraction of the pupillary sphincter muscle, resulting in dose-dependent miosis.Citation24,Citation27 In patients intoxicated with Sarin vapours (one of the most toxic organophosphorus compounds), after 24 h of exposure, the acetylcholinesterase activity was significantly lower in patients with miotic pupils than those with normal-sized pupils.Citation37 In summary, the findings of a negative medium association between AChE levels and pupil size indicate that miosis may be a sensitive index of exposure to pesticides at lower levels that can lead to other identifiable effects or poisoning. However, future research is needed to further establish and quantify this relationship.

Years of pesticide exposure were negatively correlated with pupil size under mesopic and scotopic conditions. These results are consistent with signs of acute poisoning from exposure to organophosphates, previously described as a direct consequence of the inhibition of AChE activity. Whilst AChE levels are correlated with pupil size, modified Q16 symptom scores were not (Table 1). This finding may be because the modified neurotoxic symptoms Q16 questionnaire registers more general symptoms of neurotoxicity that are not necessarily related to vision or visual impairment.

Perhaps another contributing factor is that it is well-known that significant individual differences exist in how people subjectively report their perception of pain and discomfort. Accordingly, the subjective nature and variability of individual reports of neurotoxic symptoms will likely affect the correlation strength with a specific outcome measure. Note, however, that the modified Q16 was correlated with AChE, which suggests that AChE is related to general neurotoxicity symptoms.

It is important to highlight that the exposed group in this study exclusively consisted of males, in contrast to the non-exposed group, which included 12 males and 8 females. Consequently, gender differences, along with gender-related factors such as body mass index (BMI) may be contributing factors to pupil size. Although previous studies have demonstrated the independence of pupil size from gender,Citation38,Citation39 a further analysis (t-test) was performed to determine whether the pupil size and levels of neurotoxicity of female control participants differed from their male control counterparts. This analysis revealed no statistical difference in pupil size under both mesopic (p?=?0.21) and scotopic conditions (p?=?0.45), AChE activity (p?=?0.49) as well and Q16 neurotoxicity levels (p?=?0.32), suggesting that gender may not be a contributing factor in accounting for the present findings.

It is important to consider age-related changes in pupil size, which tend to be more pronounced in significantly older individuals, with pupil size diminishing by 0.6 to 1?mm every 20?years.Citation38,Citation39 In the current study, both groups were approximately age-matched, with the exposed group averaging 31?years and the non-exposed group 27?years. The modest 4-year difference (estimated to be 0.12–0.2?mm) is anticipated to have minimal impact on the findings of this study, given the gradual rate of pupil size change associated with age.

This study demonstrates that pupil size may be used as an important biomarker or indicator for pesticide exposure; specifically, pupils size measurement can be used to detect and monitor the presence of a pesticide in the body and serve as a sign of adverse health effects caused by this exposure. This highlights the utility of pupil size measures in the broader context of other clinical tests and the medical history of the patient. As such, pupil size measurement could potentially guide clinicians towards improved diagnosis and better case management.Citation22,Citation27

The use of cost-effective and easy-to-measure biomarkers like these might help evaluate potential pesticide exposures and allow for decisions to be made about the regulation of the use of pesticides to protect human health and the prevention of pesticide toxicity. Pupil size measures can be used in conjunction with other measures of neurotoxicity (e.g., modified neurotoxic symptoms Q16) to contribute to a more comprehensive assessment of the consequences of pesticide exposure and used as a means of monitoring recovery.

"Abstract
In southeastern Spain, intensive and highly productive agriculture under plastic also poses a risk to human health, as evidenced by reports on acute pesticide poisoning and its effects on mental health. However, knowledge of chronic exposures and their relationship to psychiatric disorders is still limited. This study analyzed the relationship between occupational exposure to pesticides and psychiatric disorders in farmers from Almería. A cross-sectional study was conducted amongst a coastal population in Almería, where over 32,800 ha of land are dedicated to intensive agriculture in plastic greenhouses. A total of 409 people participated in the study: 203 farmers and 206 control subjects. The highest risk of psychiatric disorders was observed in farmers living in areas of high exposure to pesticides, working in greenhouses (intensive agriculture), without protective goggles and without wearing masks. This study supports previous evidence of an elevated risk of psychiatric disorders among farm workers exposed to pesticides.

1. Introduction
Optimal mental health is essential for personal well-being and forms the foundation for a happy, fulfilling, and productive life (OECD and European Union, 2018). However, more than one billion of the world's population suffers from some form of psychiatric disorder (Sunkel, 2022). In high-income countries, these disorders represent a significant burden of disease, with depression, anxiety disorder, and somatoform disorder being among the leading causes of years lived with disability (Arias et al., 2022, GBD 2019 Diseases and Injuries Collaborators, 2020). In the European Union (EU) one in six citizens (17.3%) has a psychiatric disorder, translating into almost 84 million people (OECD, & European Union, 2018). In Spain, according to data from the National Health Survey, approximately 10% of people reported suffering from some psychiatric disorder, with anxiety (6.7%) and depression (6.7%) being some of the most common conditions (Ministerio de Sanidad, C. y B. S, 2019). Furthermore, it has been reported that these disorders generate an annual cost for Spain that exceeds 45 billion Euros, representing a major health problem for the health system (OECD, & European Union, 2018).

Although current research is limited, studies worldwide have found significantly higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicide among farmers compared to the rest of the population (Jones-Bitton et al., 2020, Rudolphi et al., 2020, Taylor and Charlton, 2018). Some risk factors for psychiatric disorders have been identified among farmers, including economic hardship (Brew et al., 2016, Jones-Bitton et al., 2020, Rudolphi et al., 2020), social withdrawal (Brew et al., 2016, Reed and Claunch, 2020), chronic health problems (Ringgenberg et al., 2018, Scheyett et al., 2019), restricted accessibility to medical care (Brew et al., 2016, Jones et al., 2010), weather issues (Ayal et al., 2021, Berry et al., 2011), procedures and regulations (Lunner Kolstrup et al., 2013, Truchot and Andela, 2018), as well as exposure to pesticides (Campos et al., 2016, Stallones and Beseler, 2016). In 2021, Spain topped the list of EU countries in pesticide sales, with approximately 76,448 tons of product. Of that total, 10,091 tons (13.2%) were used in Almería, a region in southern Spain known for its intensive agriculture. These pesticides were used both in greenhouses (on the Almería coast) and in traditional outdoor agriculture in the inland areas (Ministerio de Agricultura, P. y A., 2021). Farmers are regularly exposed to pesticides through inhalation and skin contact, which can cause poisoning (Mackenzie Ross et al., 2010). Recent research has suggested that these pesticide-intensive agricultural practices pose a risk to human health, increasing the likelihood of disease (Gangemi et al., 2016, Lozano-Paniagua et al., 2021), including different neuropsychiatric disorders (Farnham et al., 2021, Fuhrimann et al., 2021, Zhang et al., 2016). Furthermore, because of their neurotoxic properties, pesticides can cause impairment of different physiological functions under long-term exposure conditions (Corsini et al., 2013, Mrema et al., 2013). However, few studies address the neurotoxic effects of long-term low-dose pesticide exposure (Antonangeli et al., 2023).

Currently, there is growing evidence of associated pesticide exposure with various neurological health effects (Ong-Artborirak et al., 2022, Parrón et al., 2011), including hormonal disturbances (Leemans et al., 2019), ADHD symptoms among adolescent pesticide applicators (Rohlman et al., 2019), neurodevelopmental disorders (van Wendel de Joode et al., 2016) a higher risk of dream-enacting behaviors (Yuan et al., 2022), irritability, erectile dysfunction, and sensorimotor dysfunction (Rohlman et al., 2019, Zhang et al., 2016). However, data on the mental health of farmers related to pesticide exposure is almost non-existent. In such a way that a recent systematic review has suggested paying more attention to the mental health of farmers and conducting more detailed studies on occupational exposure to pesticides (Zanchi et al., 2023). Knowing this relationship could be useful to intervene before the clinical symptoms of a psychiatric disorder appear, as well as reducing the rate of hospital admissions and the use of psychotropic drugs to improve mental health and quality of life. Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyse the relationship between occupational exposure to pesticides and mental health in farmers from Almería.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study design
A cross-sectional study was carried out to investigate the relationship between pesticide exposure and possible psychiatric disorders such as somatic symptoms, anxiety/insomnia, social dysfunction, and depression in a population living in the coastal area of Almería, located in the southeast region of Spain, where a total of 32,827 ha are dedicated to the practice of intensive agriculture within plastic greenhouses (Ministerio de Agricultura, P. y A., 2021).

2.2. Study population
The study recruited a sample of 409 participants aged between 18 and 65 years during the period from September 2021 to December 2022. The exposed group consisted of 203 individuals who worked in greenhouses (with an average area of 1 ha), performing tasks such as pruning, weeding, thinning, recollecting, and pesticide application, for a minimum of 40 h per week, over a period of at least two consecutive years. The inclusion criteria for the exposed group included being a male greenhouse farmer aged 18 years or older, having a minimum work experience of 2 years in farming and residing at their current address for at least 5 years. These greenhouse workers were recruited within the greenhouses themselves, capitalizing on the regularly scheduled occupational health surveillance conducted before the commencement of their workday. Consequently, the participation rate was nearly 100%. The control group comprised 206 healthy male participants (public administration workers), aged 18 years or older, with no prior or current history of occupational exposure to pesticides. This group consisted of healthy individuals residing in the same geographical area (municipality) but without previous or current occupational exposure to pesticides, which was an exclusion criterion. They were recruited from the Occupational Risk Prevention Centre, responsible for monitoring the health and safety conditions of employed workers in the province of Almería, as well as conducting prevention and promotion activities. Recruitment coincided with the same period of the year as that of the greenhouse workers, taking advantage of their attendance at the Centre for their scheduled occupational health examination. As they resided in the same municipality as the greenhouse workers, environmental and dietary exposure to pesticides was considered similar in both groups. Therefore, the primary distinction between them lies in pesticide exposure resulting from the performance of agricultural activities in greenhouses.

2.3. Data collection
Information collected on sociodemographic variables (age, BMI, level of education, smoking, place of residence, years of residence) was obtained at an interview with a psychiatry specialist. In addition, farmers were interviewed to collect information on agricultural tasks performed, years of work in agriculture, type of agriculture (intensive agriculture or open-air agriculture), application of pesticides, and use of personal protective equipment (PPE, eg gloves, goggles, face mask) for skin, respiratory, and eye protection.

The place of residence for the entire study population (both farmers and non-farmers) was classified into two zones (high pesticide use and low pesticide use), based on the percentage of surface area dedicated to intensive agriculture in plastic-covered greenhouses For the crop season 2020–2021, the area with high pesticide use included 96% of the greenhouse surface of the province of Almería (corresponding to Central Health District and Western Health District), while the low pesticide use included the remaining 4% of the greenhouse surface (Eastern Health District) (Ministerio de Agricultura, P. y A., 2021).

Screening for possible psychiatric disorders was carried out using the Spanish version of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) (Lobo et al., 1986). This self-administered questionnaire consists of 28 items divided into four subscales of 7 items each: Somatic symptoms, anxiety / insomnia, social dysfunction, and severe depression. The score for each item ranges from 0 to 1 depending on the answer provided (0?0-1?1). The final score is then calculated by adding all scores obtained on the 28 items. The psychometric properties obtained confirm this questionnaire as a valid instrument for evaluating possible psychiatric disorders (Cronbach's alpha coefficient: 0.77). For our study, we obtained a value of Cronbach's alpha coefficient: 0.82.

Data were collected through a face-to-face interview conducted by a trained interviewer and a psychiatrist.

The pesticides used most during the last 23 years, their classification based on the target pest group, the type of crops where they have been used, and the year when their use was banned are shown in Table 1. This information was obtained from the farmers’ responses to interview/survey questions and from the agronomists who supervised the study area during the study period.

2.4. Ethical considerations
The research study was approved by the Ethics and Research Committee of the University of Almeria (EFM 96/2021). Participation in this study was voluntary, and after being informed about the study objectives, the participants gave their written informed consent. All procedures followed the ethical standards laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki. To ensure the confidentiality of the data, a unique personal code was generated for each participant.

2.5. Data analysis
A database with study variables was created with IBM SPSS statistical software SPSS 26.0 for Windows). Descriptive analysis was performed using means and standard deviations for continuous variables, while absolute and relative frequency distributions were calculated for dichotomic and categorical variables. Chi-square tests were performed to assess the distribution of dichotomic and categorical variables for the outcome of the study. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to assess whether the continuous variables (age, years of residence, somatic symptoms, anxiety/insomnia, social dysfunction, severe depression, and years working in agriculture) were normally distributed. As these continuous data were nonnormally distributed, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was used for further comparisons. Rosenthal´r was used to report effect sizes: small (0,10), medium (0,24) and large (0,37) (Coe and Merino Soto, 2003, Rosenthal and Rubin, 1982). Bivariate correlations were performed for continuous variables using Spearman's Rho correlation coefficient (see supplementary material). The risk of psychiatric disorders was calculated in the subgroup of farmers as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using Chi-square test. The strength of association between nominal variables was obtained using Cramer's V.

Multiple logistic regression analysis was employed to assess the risk of psychiatric disorders in both the total study population and the subgroup of farmers. The models were adjusted for independent variables that exhibited statistically significant differences in the bivariate analysis. These variables included labor status (farmers vs. non-farmers), and place of residence (area with low use of pesticides vs. area with high use of pesticides). Additionally, for the model in the subgroup of farmers, we included variables such as wearing goggles (yes/no) and wearing a face mask (yes/no). We also considered potential confounding factors, including age, educational level, BMI, and monthly family income. The dependent variable was the presence of psychiatric disorders (yes/no). The level of statistical significance was set at a p-value < 0.05.

A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), a graphical structure that captures the causal and conditional connections between different variables, was constructed using the Hill Climbing algorithm. The graph was plotted using DAGitty software (https://www.dagitty.net/) (Tennant et al., 2021).

3. Results
A total of 409 individuals participated in the study, 203 greenhouse workers (farmers) and 206 control subjects (non-agricultural).

The main characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 2. The mean age was similar in both study groups, and the BMI distribution was comparable, with the majority having a normal BMI (65.5% versus 58%). Concerning the level of education, participants in the non-agricultural group showed a higher percentage at a medium level (36.9%), while in the agricultural occupation group, the highest percentage was observed for a low educational level (36.5%). Regarding household income per month, 90.1% of the agricultural occupation group and 87.4% of the non-agricultural group reported an income between 1200 and 2500€. Participants in both the agricultural occupation and non-agricultural groups primarily resided in areas with high pesticide use (77.3% versus 70.9%). No significant differences were observed for age, BMI, education level, household income per month, smoking, place of residence, and length of residence (years) on the current farm. All participants were of Spanish nationality.

Table 3 shows the mean scores for somatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia, social dysfunction, and severe depression in agricultural occupation and non-agricultural. The levels of somatic symptoms, anxiety/insomnia, social dysfunction, and severe depression were higher in farmers compared to non-farmers (p = 0.001), with the highest scores observed for anxiety/insomnia in both groups (Rosenthal´r: 0.34). The total score of the GHQ-28 to assess psychiatric disorders was also significantly higher in farmers compared to non-farmers (farmers: 10.24 (3.27), non-agricultural: 7.63 (2.67), Rosenthal´r: 0.39; p = 0.001). 72.4% of farmers had psychiatric disorders compared to 44.7% of non-farmers (Cramer´s V: 0.28), and these results were statistically significant.

Table 4 shows the risk of psychiatric disorders in farmers, expressed as OR, adjusted for intensive farming (plastic-covered greenhouses) vs. extensive agriculture (open air), areas of high vs. low pesticide use, and use of no vs. any PPE during their workday. A significantly increased risk of psychiatric disorders was found for farmers who did not wear goggles, gloves and masks compared to the control group. The highest statistically significant risks were observed for farmers residing in areas of high pesticide use compared to those residing in areas of low pesticide use (OR: 4.26; p = 0.001) and for farmers working in intensive agriculture (greenhouses) relative to those in extensive crops (open-air agriculture) (OR: 2.46; p = 0.02).

The results of the multiple logistic regression analysis, examining factors associated with the development of psychiatric disorders in a) the entire study population and b) farmers, are presented in Table 5. The model for the total population was adjusted for age, BMI, educational level, monthly household income, labor status, and place of residence as independent variables. In the total population, a significantly greater risk of psychiatric disorders was observed for farmers and those residing in areas with high pesticide use (OR 3.29 and 1.90, respectively, p < 0.001). The model for farmers was adjusted for age, IBM, educational level, household income per month, type of agriculture, place of residence, and wearing gloves, goggles, and face mask, as independent variables. The highest risk of psychiatric disorders was observed for farmers who resided in areas of high pesticide exposure (OR=4.33; p = 0.001), those who worked in greenhouses (intensive agriculture) relative to those who worked in open-air crops (extensive agriculture) (OR: 2.78; p = 0.01), those who did not wear goggles during working days (OR=2.39; p = 0.01) and those who did not wear a face mask while working (OR: 2.07; p = 0.04).

4. Discussion
The present study sought to analyse the relationship between occupational exposure to pesticides and mental health among farmers in Almería. To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no studies in Spain on psychiatric disorders in farmers exposed to pesticides. The results of this study suggest an association between occupational exposure to pesticides and psychiatric disorders. Among the farmers surveyed, increased exposure was significantly associated with higher levels of somatic symptoms, anxiety/insomnia, social dysfunction, and severe depressive symptoms, resulting in higher total GHQ-28 total scores. Farmers who lived in areas with high exposure and worked in greenhouses (intensive farming) had a higher risk of psychiatric disorders. Considering the agricultural workers affected, the risk of psychiatric disorders was higher for those who did not use glasses and masks while handling pesticides. These results further support the adverse effects of occupational exposure on cognitive function and mental health.

Human health is negatively affected by most pesticides due to their impact on neurological functions (Jokanovi? et al., 2023, Kim et al., 2017, Meyer-Baron et al., 2015). The results of this study revealed a higher total score on GHQ-28 for farmers exposed to pesticides, indicating an increased risk of psychiatric disorders. The four domains assessed by the questionnaire (somatic symptoms, anxiety/insomnia, social dysfunction, and severe depression) showed higher levels in farm workers compared to non-farmers. These findings are consistent with previous studies (Conti et al., 2018, Harrison and Mackenzie Ross, 2016, Koh et al., 2017). Previously, increased symptoms of anxiety and depression were observed in sheepherders with a history of exposure to low levels of organophosphate pesticides (Harrison and Mackenzie Ross, 2016). A similar association was observed in another study, where rates of anxiety/insomnia and severe depression were also significantly higher in farmers exposed to organophosphate pesticides than in controls (Malekirad et al., 2013). A similar association between pesticide exposure and the development of depressive symptoms was observed in another study conducted with farmers in southeastern Brazil. Specifically, exposure to glyphosate in conjunction with flutriafol, cyproconazole, and thiamethoxam was found to be associated with depressive symptoms (Conti et al., 2018). Notably, these same types of pesticides are commonly used in our study area. The most recent evidence clearly supports the association between exposure and the development of depressive symptoms (Cancino et al., 2023). Recently, researchers have suggested an association between depression in agricultural workers and exposure to organophosphates, specifically chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin. Importantly, both of these products are also used in our study area (Kori et al., 2020). These results reinforce the importance of investigating and addressing the risks associated with exposure to organophosphate pesticides in relation to depression in adults (Wu et al., 2023). In addition, a relationship has been established between reduced levels of neurotransmitters in blood and urine, elevated levels of monoamine oxidase and pesticide residues in plasma and urine, and a higher incidence of depression in agricultural workers (Kori et al., 2020).

Farmers who lived in areas with high exposure had the highest risk of psychiatric disorders (OR = 4.33), while those who worked in greenhouses (intensive agriculture) had the highest risk compared to those who worked in outdoor crops. free (extensive agriculture) (OR = 2.78). There are several factors that influence the appearance of negative health effects after occupational exposure to pesticides. These include handling and spraying of pesticides, wind dispersal of agricultural pesticides, improper use, or lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), incorrect knowledge or perceptions, contact with contaminated clothing, hot weather conditions, the consumption of food, drinks, and tobacco during or after the use of pesticides, and the lack of personal hygiene (washing hands or showering) (Suratman et al., 2015). Our study found that farmers who did not use goggles and masks when handling pesticides had a higher risk (OR = 2.39 and OR = 2.07, respectively) of suffering from a psychiatric disorder compared to those who did. Therefore, the correct use of personal protective equipment during agricultural activities and the compliance with safe practises when handling pesticides can reduce total exposure to these chemical products (Yarpuz-Bozdogan, 2018), thus avoiding harmful effects on health and appearance of psychiatric disorders.

This study has important implications for clinical practice and health policy development. First, health surveillance and awareness among farmers should be strengthened, especially regarding the potential impact of pesticide exposure on cognitive function and mental health. Second, more stringent pesticide use policies and protective measures must be implemented to reduce farmers' exposure to these chemicals. Furthermore, the government and relevant agencies should provide more training and education to improve farmers' safety awareness of the use of pesticides and improve their skills in their correct application. Finally, the transition of agricultural production to more environmentally friendly and sustainable practices and reducing the reliance on pesticides must be encouraged to protect the health of farmers and the sustainability of the environment.

There are some limitations in this study that should be considered. First of all, this is a cross-sectional study and cannot determine the cause-and-effect relationship. Long-term follow-up studies are needed to determine the causal relationship between pesticide exposure, cognitive function, and mental health. Second, the sample in this study is made up of farmers from specific regions, which may have regional specificities. Since the sample selection is not random, there may be selection bias. The collection of data for this article is based on the recall of respondents, who may have recall bias and reporting bias. The interviews were conducted by trained personnel and a psychiatrist to try to minimize information bias. Third, this study does not provide information on quantitative measurements of exposure to pesticides. The number of treatments per month or per year cannot be normalized as it depends on the variety of fruits and vegetables grown each year, the weather conditions, etc. All these factors have an impact on the appearance of pests and therefore on the type and amount of pesticides used.

Therefore, the generalizability of the results is limited, and more attention should be paid to farmers from other regions and different farming environments. Furthermore, this study only considered pesticide exposure and did not consider the impact of other possible occupational and environmental factors on cognitive function and mental health.

5. Conclusion
This study supports findings suggesting an increased risk of psychiatric disorders in the population associated with pesticide exposure and extends the increased risk to farmers occupationally exposed to pesticides, particularly those who do not use or use PPE.

"Abstract
Pesticide poisoning is a common medical emergency in the rural tropics, with significant associated mortality. Pesticide poisoning is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of substances with differing clinical toxidromes and outcomes. Despite this, confirmation of the specific compound ingested is rarely performed. In this Lessons from the Field, we argue that pesticide-specific management is integral to optimise management. Using data from a quality improvement project in Chittagong, Bangladesh, we demonstrate that identifying the specific compound is possible in most patients through careful history taking and examination of the pesticide bottle. Identification of the specific compound is essential for anticipating and reducing complications, administering appropriate and timely management and reducing the length of hospital stay and cost of unnecessary medical intervention.

Issue Section: Lessons From The Field
Pesticide poisoning is a major global health problem. Each year there are an estimated 110 000–168 000 deaths resulting from acute self-poisoning with pesticides.1 Most deaths occur due to deliberate self-poisoning in agricultural communities of Africa and Asia. Following the successful introduction of pesticide legislation and the banning of class 1 highly hazardous pesticides in some countries, there has been a reduction in pesticide poisoning–related mortality and increasing diversification of pesticide use.2 This increased diversification of pesticide use has resulted in a greater variety of pesticides responsible for poisonings.

Pesticides used for deliberate self-poisoning result in a wide spectrum of clinical toxidromes. Clinical outcomes can range from having minimal symptoms with an excellent prognosis to severe cholinergic crisis including bronchospasm, bronchorrhoea, miosis, sweating, agitation and muscle paralysis causing high case fatality rates. Within pesticide classes such as organophosphate (OP) insecticides, there is considerable heterogeneity in clinical features, complications and outcomes dependent on which specific OP compound is ingested.3 For example, dimethoate OP poisoning typically causes an acute cholinergic crisis and cardiovascular instability. This differs markedly from poisoning from highly lipid soluble OP compounds such as fenthion, which causes fewer cholinergic features and less cardiovascular instability but occasional delayed neuromuscular paralysis.3 This heterogeneity is further complicated by variations in formulation (powder, granules and liquid), pesticide concentration, solvents, emulsification and mixed compounds that can influence ingested dose and absorption.

Despite variations in clinical manifestations, complications and outcomes, many patients with a history of pesticide ingestion present with similar clinical features, including vomiting, miosis and reduced conscious level.4 This can make a compound-specific diagnosis based on toxidrome alone challenging. Due to historically high rates of OP poisoning and associated high case fatality rates, patients are commonly treated empirically with OP-specific treatments including atropine and pralidoxime.5

During a 3-month period from November 2015 to February 2016, patients presenting to Chittagong Medical College, Bangladesh with a history of pesticide poisoning were interviewed within 24 h of admission as part of a quality improvement project. The compound ingested was identified from the history provided by the patient or relatives, examination of the pesticide bottle or a photograph of the pesticide bottle. The confirmed compound was then compared with the clinical diagnosis made on admission by the attending medical team in which specific compounds were rarely identified. The clinical teams were notified of circumstances in which the clinical diagnosis differed from that determined by the research team.

During the observation period, 314 patients presented with a history of pesticide ingestion. The specific compound was identified from the history or bottle in 221/314 (70.4%) patients (Table 1). Of the 314 patients, the majority (283 [90.1%]) were initially diagnosed and managed as OP or carbamate poisoning based on clinical presentation. In patients empirically managed as OP/carbamate poisoning, the compound ingested was subsequently identified by history or the bottle in 198 patients. A total of 63/198 patients (31.8%) had ingested other insecticides and were therefore misdiagnosed based on clinical toxidrome.

Pesticide poisoning is common and often neglected. Clinical manifestations vary considerably, both between and within pesticide groups, necessitating individualised care. In this quality improvement project and through our personal experience of managing acute pesticide poisoning, identification of the specific compound and formulation is possible in most patients but rarely performed. Identification is possible through history and examination of the pesticide bottle without the need for complex diagnostic equipment or toxicological analysis. Identification is made easier when using a national database of locally available compounds with brand names. This method of pesticide identification has been found to correlate with toxicological analysis in >80% of cases.3,6 Identifying the specific compound and formulation ingested allows the attending clinician to deliver appropriate emergency care, anticipate potential complications, improve prognostication and ultimately deliver patient-centred care.

As demonstrated in this study, there is a tendency to overdiagnose OP poisoning and initiate emergency treatment, including decontamination of gastric contents using nasogastric lavage and OP-specific antidotes. Acute pyrethroid poisoning can often mimic OP poisoning, with similarities in the toxidrome including vomiting, miosis and reduced consciousness.4 A misdiagnosis of pyrethroid or other pesticide poisoning as OP poisoning exposes patients to potentially harmful medical interventions. Furthermore, these interventions place huge additional financial burdens on patients and increase the hospital length of stay.5

In addition to helping guide emergency management, identification of specific compounds may help clinicians anticipate complications and guide prognosis. Highly lipid-soluble OP compounds such as fenthion have been associated with delayed-onset respiratory failure and patients may benefit from enhanced observation and frequent assessment of tidal volume to detect imminent respiratory failure. Paraquat, a non-selective herbicide, can cause progressive irreversible pulmonary renal syndrome. Appreciation of its progressive nature and poor outcome may help clinicians understand the limitations of ventilation in patients with respiratory failure.6

Conclusions
Emergency management of patients presenting with acute pesticide poisoning should include both clinical assessment of the toxidrome and an attempt to identify the specific compound from history, the bottle or photographs. Identification of the specific compound ingested from self-poisoning is possible in most patients and is key to predicting and reducing complications, administering appropriate and timely management and reducing the length of hospital stay and cost from unnecessary medical interventions.

1. Introduction
Pesticides have been widely used in the modern agricultural system and food industry. They play a major role in preventing huge yield losses of food crop production caused by plant pests infestation and diseases, and therefore have gained the widespread acceptance on a global scale [1]. However, except the risk to human health and ecosystems, excessive utilization of pesticides also causes negative impacts on aquatic environments due to the increased pesticides content in water through run-off, spray drift, leaching, and subsurface drainage [2]. The emerging pesticides in water pose a threat to public health, which require sustainable monitoring and remediation technologies [3]. Many analytical methods have been explored to detect them based on chromatography, optical spectrometry, electrochemical analysis, and etc [4]. Simultaneously, many technologies have been developed to remove them [3], such as nanofiltration, photocatalytic degradation, biological treatment, and extraction.

Solid phase extraction (SPE) is a traditional extraction technology [5], which has received worldwide acceptance for extraction of pesticides from polluted water [6]. The technology conducts on adsorption of target pesticides onto functional solid sorbents, and aims for removal or determination of pesticides (Fig. 1). For removal of pesticides, the dominant SPE procedure is based on the adsorption, which comprises physical adsorption and chemical adsorption. In physical adsorption, the electronic structures of the sorbent and adsorbed pesticides are generally not modified, and the adsorption affinities between sorbent and pesticides are weak, such as Van der Waals attraction force. On the contrary, in chemical adsorption, the electronic structures of both sorbent and pesticides are changed due to the formed and/or broken chemical bonds upon adsorption, and the adsorption affinities between sorbent and pesticides are stronger than that of physical adsorption [7]. Sometimes physical adsorption and chemical adsorption both occur at the interface between solid sorbent and aqueous solution. The chemical affinities dominated adsorption is hard to achieve the desorption, which can cause the sorbent hard to reuse, therefore, to achieve the reuse of sorbent for removal of pesticides from polluted water, the required adsorption affinities should be moderate. For determination of the pesticide in polluted water, SPE technology is used for sample preparation which can eliminate the effect of matrix interference and enrichment of target analytes [8]. The SPE procedures aim at sample preparation generally comprise adsorption, desorption, and analysis. The sorbent, also called extractant, acts for enrichment and concentrating of target pesticides. After enrichment, the pesticides with high concentrations can be easily detected by analytical instrument.

The core technology of SPE depends on the functional adsorbing materials, and the effective adsorption is based on the covalent or non-covalent interactions between sorbent and target adsorbates. Generally, covalent interactions supported adsorption leads to the dead adsorption, so the adsorbates are hard to desorb, and the sorbent is correspondingly hard to reuse. This type of adsorption can be used for pesticides removal, but is hard to use for pesticides determination. In view of that, non-covalent interactions based adsorption is generally designed. Frequently mentioned non-covalent interactions in adsorption process include Van der Waals force, capillary force, ?-? interaction, hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen-bonding, electrostatic interaction, and coordination interaction [8]. Generally, multiple non-covalent interactions jointly promote the adsorption. Based on these adsorption interactions, various functional sorbents have been explored for pesticides removal or determination, such as inorganic mineral [9], metal and metallic compound [10,11], silicon material [12], carbon material [13], and composite material [14]. Among these sorbents, carbon materials have attracted most attentions, and a number of carbon materials have been employed or explored for pesticides removal or determination from polluted water, which can be divided into 12 types, including natural carbon material, biochar, activated carbon, graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), fullerene, carbon dots, carbon fiber, derived carbon material, doped carbon material, carbon based polymer, and carbon composite.

To be a desirable adsorption material with application potentials, porous structure and functional groups are generally indispensable. Carbon materials meet the above two requirements, and simultaneously exhibit other advantages such as tunable porous structure, large specific surface area, satisfactory stability, unique electronic structure, diverse and broad types, and easy modification, which promote them to be a type of promising sorbents for pesticides removal and determination. Considerable researches have been reported, and a number of microporous, mesoporous, macroporous, and hierarchically porous carbon materials with ordered or disordered structures have been increasingly explored and used for pesticides removal or determination. The statistics of publications number about carbon materials extraction based pesticides removal and determination over the latest ten years according to web of science is 2540. Among these publications, some review articles focused on pesticides removal based on cellulose [15], nanocomposites [16], sustainable adsorbents [17], but these articles didn't systematically discuss the carbon materials based pesticides removal. Some review articles focused on pesticides determination, such as review of graphitized carbon black and porous graphitic carbon for analytical applications in liquid phase [18], and review of pesticides monitoring in water matrices [4], these reviews also didn't discuss the advanced carbon materials for various pesticides extraction and determination. Therefore, a comprehensive, detailed, and latest review is deficient for summarizing the advances and applications of carbon materials in the pesticides extraction and determination fields. This review highlights the developments and applications of carbon materials for pesticides removal and determination, and detailedly presents their characteristics, properties, functional strategies, and application strategies. The review aims to further promote the theory cognition of carbon sorbents, and also aims to further expand the exploration strategies and application technologies of carbon materials in polluted water treatment.

2. Advances of carbon materials in pesticides removal and determination
Carbon materials have attracted increasing attentions in pesticides removal and SPE based determination from polluted water. Varieties of carbon materials, with nanometer or non-nanometer scale, ordered or disordered structure, different pore diameters, and diverse functional groups, have been continually explored and used in the fields.

2.1. Natural carbon material
Carbon materials are widely existed in nature, some of which are natural sorbents with superior adsorption ability toward pesticides. These carbon sorbents generally have porous structure, larger surface area, and certain chemical groups. Due to their easily available, low cost and low pollution, they have potentials for effective adsorption of pesticides, such as sunflower seed shells and rice husk, having better adsorption ability than soil, which can be used for simazine and chlorpyrifos removal from polluted water [19]. Another application strategy is established by immobilization of a catalyst onto the natural carbon material which can adsorb pesticide, the adsorbed pesticide can be gradually catalytic degraded and thus effectively removed [20]. Natural carbon materials are generally easily obtained from natural environment, and are cheap and environmental-friendly. However, their adsorption abilities are limited, and their functionalization is indispensable.

Carbonization and activation are two critical procedures for natural carbon materials functionalization. Carbonization of natural carbon materials can produce biochar, activation of natural carbon materials or biochar can produce activated carbon. Biochar and activated carbon are two widely used sorbents for removal of pesticides from polluted water.

2.2. Biochar
Biochar is an effective carbonaceous sorbent, which can be readily obtained through the pyrolysis process of biomass under oxygen-limited conditions [21]. Many agricultural wastes and wood can be utilized as raw materials for preparation of low-cost biochar [22], therefore it is readily available. With its porous structure, abundant surface reactive groups, and high surface area, biochar exhibits superior affinity for adsorbing of pesticides. A series of biochar materials, derived from corn stalk and cob [21,23], eucalyptus wood chips [22], grape pomace [24], coconut shell [25], cotton straw [26], and so on, have been explored as promising candidates for removal of various types of pesticides from polluted water.

Except for removal of pesticides, some biochar can be employed for sample preparation based pesticides determination, but the required adsorption affinities should be moderate, and desorption operations should be easily achieved. For instance, a magnetic biochar was prepared by pyrolyzing the mixture of corn straw powder and Fe2+/Fe3+ at high temperature, the magnetic biochar exhibited desirable adsorption ability toward organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) based on ?-? interaction and hydrogen bonding, and the adsorbed pesticides achieved satisfactory desorption, therefore the magnetic sorbent was successfully used for trace OPPs enriching and determination from environmental water [27]. However, most of the reported biochar was used for pesticides removal, and the reported biochar for pesticides determination purpose was scarce, which may be attributed to the hard desorption of adsorbed pesticides from biochar.

2.3. Activated carbon
Activated carbon is the most widely used sorbent for removal of pesticides from polluted water due to its outstanding surface properties such as high surface area, abundant surface chemical groups, and desirable porosity generally consisting of a network of interconnected macrospores, mesopores, and micropores [28]. Most of the reported activated carbon for adsorption of pesticides originated from carbonization and activation of natural carbon precursors such as date stones [29], banana stalk [30], tangerine seed [31], and oil-palm fiber [32], some of them were derived from carbonization and activation of industrial carbon products such as viscose [33]. Besides, some commercialized activated carbon can be directly purchased for pesticides adsorption from polluted water whether in powder or granular form, such as F300-activated carbon [34], AG-activated carbon [35], and Spectracarb 2225-activated carbon cloth [36].

Carbonization and activation are two critical procedures for preparation of activated carbon. Some activated carbon were prepared based on carbonization followed by activation of raw materials [37], whereas others were prepared based on activation followed by carbonization of raw materials [38]. Carbonization process is generally carried out by pyrolysis of raw materials under oxygen-limited conditions. Activation process contains physical activation and chemical activation. Physical activation can optimize the size, specific surface, pore density, pore volume, pore radius, and other physical properties of carbon materials, but can't change their chemical structures, such as mechanical grinding obtained nano-sized date pits, with significantly improved surface area, having excellent removal capacity for profenofos in aqueous solution [39]. Chemical activation is frequently used for functionalization of carbon materials, which can change the chemical structures of materials, and can introduce new adsorption groups for them. Most of the reported activation strategies belong to chemical activation, and many activating agents have been explored, such as inorganic compound [38], acid [31], and alkali [37]. If only carbonization procedure is implemented, the obtained carbon materials belong to un-activated biochar which has weaker adsorptivity toward pesticides due to the lack of functional adsorption groups. Therefore, activated carbon can also be gained by further chemical activation of biochar. Acid activation of biochar is one of the important chemical activation strategies for preparation of activated carbon, such as phosphoric acid activated biochar which can enhance the removal efficiency for multiple pesticides based on ?-? dispersive interaction, Van der Waals force and hydrogen bonding interaction [40], and hydrofluoric acid activated biochar which exhibited enhanced removal efficiency toward 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid from wastewater [21]. In addition, acid activation can introduce heteroatoms onto biochar. Heteroatoms doping is also an effective chemical activation strategy for preparation of activated carbon, which can introduce functionality onto biochar and improve their adsorption ability toward pesticides. For instance, phosphorus atom doped biochar exhibited desirable adsorption ability toward triazine pesticides based on Van der Waals force, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction, and pore filling, and can be utilized as a promising candidate for rapid and efficient removal of triazine pesticides from polluted water [41]. Besides, metal doping into biochar is another effective chemical activation strategy for preparation of activated carbon. For instance, zerovalent iron supported biochar exhibited enhanced adsorption ability toward organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) based on ?-? electron-donor-acceptor interaction, hydrophobic interaction, and pore filling, and was successfully utilized for simultaneous removal of several OCPs from polluted water [42].

As compared to biochar, activated carbon can be better used for pesticides extraction and determination from polluted water owing to the activation process introduced surface functional groups which can promote target pesticides easily adsorbed and desorbed. Some reported works employed activated carbon for pesticides determination from polluted water, such as oil palm fiber derived activated carbon for OCPs extraction and gas chromatography determination from polluted water [32], and activated carbon fiber for OCPs determination from polluted water based on the micro-extraction coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry [43].

2.4. Graphene
Graphene is an extensively concerned renewable carbon nanomaterial for pesticides removal and determination. It has unique honeycomb structure constructed by single or few layer thicknesses of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms [44], and has unique physic-chemical properties such as high specific area, and ?-? electrostatic stacking property [45]. Owing to its hexagonal, packed-lattice structure, and large delocalized ?-electron system, graphene can form desirable hydrophobic and ?-stacking interactions with target pesticide molecules, which makes it a fascinating sorbent for pesticides removal and determination [46]. Numbers of works regarding graphene-based carbon materials have been reported for pesticides removal or determination, such as graphene oxide [47], reduced graphene oxide [13], polymer functionalized graphene oxide [48], silica coated graphene oxide [49], and CNTs composited graphene [50]. It can be found from these researches that graphene can be variously functionalized by functional groups, compounds, polymers, and materials to tackle with different pesticides. Actually, pure graphene is a good sorbent for some organic compounds based on the hydrophobic and ?-stacking interactions [46], but its functional groups are deficiently. Graphene oxide has more hydrophilic groups such as epoxide, carboxylic, and hydroxyl groups, and exhibits enhanced hydrophilicity than pure graphene [48], which can be better used for some polar pesticides adsorption based on hydrogen-bonding, electrostatic, and ?-? interactions. However, sometimes the strong affinities of graphene oxide make the desorption operations difficult, therefore reduced graphene oxide was further explored to reduce its functional adsorption groups. In addition, other functionalization strategies are easily accomplished due to the facilely modified features of graphene, and various graphene based composites have been explored in recent years, such as magnetic graphene, ionic surfactants functionalized graphene, polymers functionalized graphene, ionic liquids functionalized graphene, and materials functionalized graphene [51], these functionalization strategies have made graphene a promising sorbent for removal or determination of various pesticides.

2.5. Carbon nanotubes
CNTs is another well-known carbon sorbent with porous, layered, hollow structure and high surface area [52]. It can be classified into single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with the diameter of 1–2 nm and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with the diameter of 5–50 nm according to the number of layers [53]. Due to the superior properties such as easily achieve ?-stacking interactions and easily to be functionalized, CNTs has been widely explored for pesticides removal and determination from polluted water, such as SWCNTs for OCPs determination [54], MWCNTs for fenuron removal and heterocyclic pesticides determination [55,56], aminated CNTs for phenoxycarboxylic acid herbicides determination [57], metal modified CNTs for devrinol and triadimefon removal [53], and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) functionalized CNTs for chipton and alachlor removal [58]. It can be seen that pure CNTs and functionalized CNTs both have been explored for pesticides extraction. Generally, the adsorption groups of pure CNTs are deficient, and the corresponding adsorption affinities of pure CNTs are mainly hydrophobic and ?-? interactions, which are relatively weak and extensive, causing pure CNTs weaker adsorptivity. However, after modification by functional groups, functional reagents and functional materials, the adsorption groups of CNTs are significantly increased, the adsorption affinities of CNTs toward target adsorbates are also apparently enhanced by introducing of hydrogen-bonding, electrostatic, and coordination interactions [52]. Acted as an excellent sorbent, CNTs can not only be used for pesticides removal, but also can be used for pesticides determination. Notably, MWCNTs was reported more than SWCNTs in the fields of pesticides removal and determination, which may be due to the low cost and easily available of MWCNTs.

2.6. Fullerene
Fullerene (C60) is known as its unique three-dimensional ? electron delocalized spherical structure with large ? conjugated system and rigid molecular framework [59]. Its adsorption ability against aliphatic, cyclic and aromatic compounds was found to be higher than that of activated carbon [60], and can be used for advanced treatment of wastewater due to the high adsorption performance [61]. Owing to its high specific area and strong hydrophobicity, fullerene can be used for pesticides extraction based on the hydrophobic and ?-? interactions. The computational simulations indicated that fullerene was a good candidate with desirable adsorption ability for removal of glyphosate from water [62], and a work focused on the adsorption of atrazine by aqueous dispersions of fullerenes indicated that smaller sizes of fullerene particles had better adsorption ability due to the increased available sites [63]. It can be found that fullerene has potentials for extraction of pesticides from polluted water, but the real applications in removal and determination of pesticides were less reported.

2.7. Carbon dots
Carbon dots represent a type of emerging nanoscale quasi-spherical shape carbon materials. They have attracted widely scientific attentions in catalysis, chemical sensing, bioimaging, and sample preparation due to the unique physical-chemical properties [64]. Various structures of carbon dots can be prepared with the top-down or bottom-up strategies by employing natural or synthetic carbon as the precursors [65], and the prepared carbon dots can obtain the active groups by inheriting from the precursors or post-functionalization. The inherited active groups, as well as other superior properties such as high surface-to-volume ratio and excellent dispersion capability in aqueous, make them suitable sorbents for pesticides removal and determination from polluted water. For instance, citric acid derived graphene quantum dots was prepared with the microwave-assisted hydrothermal strategy, the quantum dots can be used for oxamyl high-efficient removal from polluted water [66], zero valent Fe-reduced graphene oxide quantum dots was prepared as a magnetic sorbent, which can be used for OPPs extraction from polluted water [67].

2.8. Carbon fiber
Carbonaceous fiber materials have been concerned in pesticides extraction field due to their remarkable advantages such as microporous structure, high surface areas, and low cost [68]. Generally, un-activated carbon fibers are hard to adsorb target adsorbates due to their poor adsorption ability, but they can be used as extraction supporters for immobilization of effective sorbents, such as carbonaceous hollow fiber [64]. The needed carbon fiber for pesticides extraction should be activated through functional material derivation or post-functionalization strategies. Functional material derivation is a direct strategy to preparation of activated carbon fibers, such as zeolitic imidazolate framework derived nanoporous carbon fiber, which can be used as a promising sorbent for pyrethroid pesticides determination [69]. Post-functionalization is a common strategy for carbon fiber activation, such as physical deposition of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles onto carbon fiber, which can improve the adsorption ability of carbon fiber toward atrazine due to the synergistic effect of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles and carbon fiber [68], and chemical vapour deposition grown iron nanoparticles dispersed onto carbon fiber, which can make the carbon fiber to be a promising magnetic sorbent for multi-pesticide residues extraction and determination from polluted water [70].

2.9. Derived carbon material
Derived carbon materials have attracted extensive attentions for pollutants effective adsorption. Various carbon or carbon doped raw materials can be employed for preparation of derived carbon materials based on the pyrolysis and carbonization procedures, such as natural materials, industrial products, and synthetic carbon materials. These derived carbon materials generally have porosity and desirable surface area, and their adsorption groups can be enhanced by functional groups doped materials direct carbonization or post-activation after carbonization. Therefore, derived carbon materials generally have different structures and properties due to the inheriting from various raw materials or experiencing various post-activation, which are promising candidates for removal or determination of pesticides from polluted water, such as natural walnut shells derived carbon material for thiodicarb removal [71], straw and newspaper derived carbon materials for imidacloprid and sulfadiazine removal [72], synthetic MOFs derived porous carbon for pesticides removal and determination [73,74]. It is worth mentioning that MOFs derived carbon materials have promising application potentials for pesticides removal or determination based on the inorganic-organic hybridization.

2.10. Doped carbon material
Doped carbon materials have been widely concerned for pesticides extraction due to the functionalization by doping, and various doping forms have been reported for natural or synthetic carbon materials, such as heteroatoms doping and metal doping [75,76]. Generally, there are two approaches can be adopted for preparation of doped carbon materials, one approach is based on the reaction of doped raw materials, and another is based on the post-doping of prepared carbon materials. Many doped carbon materials are prepared by the first approach, such as MOFs, a type of extensively concerned doped materials based on the coordination reaction between metal ions and organic ligands, which have promising application potentials for pesticides removal and determination due to their high surface area, tunable pore size, easy functionalization, and facile production [77], and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), another widely concerned nitrogen doped adsorption material prepared by high temperature pyrolysis of abundant nitrogen contained materials such as melamine [78]. In this approach, carbonization of doped raw materials is a common strategy for preparation of doped carbon materials, such as carbonization of MOFs produced nitrogen and metal doped carbon materials [75,79], and carbonization of H3PO4-doped corn straw produced P doped biochar [41]. Besides, functionalization of metals with polymers is another strategy for preparation of metal doped carbon materials, such as polymer functionalized TiO2 [11], and chitosan functionalized Ag nanoparticles [10]. The second strategy for preparation of doped carbon materials is based on the further non-covalent or covalent modification of prepared carbon materials. Non-covalent strategy is easily available, such as MOF hybrid graphene oxide with non-covalent interactions [80]. Covalent strategy is relatively hard to achieve, such as metal ions doped carbon material based on the coordination reaction between metal ions and surface functional groups of carbon materials [81].

2.11. Carbon based polymer
Carbon based polymers are widely reported for pesticides removal and determination, such as chitosan, cellulose, cyclodextrin, molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP), MOF, covalent organic framework (COF), monopolymer, copolymer, polymer composite, and etc.

Among these polymers, chitosan, cellulose, and cyclodextrin are three widely concerned natural polymers in many fields, and can be used for both pesticides removal and sample preparation based determination due to their unique polymer structures resulted desirable properties, sometimes modification strategies for them are indispensable for better adsorption of pesticides, such as magnetic nanoparticles loading [82], hyperbranched polymers grafting [83], metal doping [84], hemimicelle mixing [85], other polymer and material hybridization [86,87].

MIP is prepared based on the polymerization reaction between the functional monomer and cross-linker in the presence of target molecules. After the target molecules are eluted, the obtained polymer possesses specific cavities which are perfect binding sites with suitable size, shape, and functional groups for selective adsorption of target adsorbates [88,89]. This type of polymers has been widely concerned in pesticides removal and determination mainly due to the outstanding selectivity. Various MIPs have been explored for pesticides extraction, such as MIPs for OPPs and chlorpyrifos determination [90,91], and MIPs for chlorpyrifos removal [92]. Sometimes functionalization for MIPs is necessary, such as magnetism functionalization [92], and hybridization functionalization [88].

MOFs can be considered as a type of metal doped carbon polymers, as mentioned before, they are significant sorbents for pesticides adsorption due to their structure diversity and universal superior properties [93]. Many types of MOFs have been explored for pesticides removal or determination from polluted water, such as MOF-199 [94], MOF-5 [95], MIL-101 [96], and ZIF-8 [97].

COFs are a type of emerging poly-porous carbon polymers based on the covalent bonds linking, which have attracted remarkable attentions as promising sorbents for extraction of pesticides due to their distinctive characteristics such as high surface area, adjustable porosity, tunable pore size, high adsorption efficiency, and recyclability [98]. Diverse COFs constructed by different functional monomers have been explored for pesticides removal or determination from polluted water, such as spherical COF for neonicotinoid insecticides determination [99], sheet-like COF for benzoylurea insecticides determination [100], plate-like COF for chlorpyrifos determination [101], and fluffy ball-like COF for organothiophosphate pesticides removal [102]. Functionalized COF are also continually explored for pesticides extraction, such as magnetic COF [103], amino-modified COF [104], and material functionalized COF [105].

Monopolymer and copolymer are two general carbon based polymers, and some of them can be employed for pesticides effective extraction. For instance, polyethylene and polystyrene microplastics, two monopolymers belonging to potential environmental pollutants, can be used as sorbents for pesticides removal [106,107]; polypyrrole, a conductive monopolymer, can be used as a SPE sorbent for pesticides determination [108].

Polymer composites have been widely explored for pesticides adsorption based on integrating the advantages of polymers and other functional materials. Various polymer composites have been reported for pesticides removal and determination from polluted water, such as magnetic polymer for pesticides determination [109], polymer coated mesoporous silica for chloridazon removal [110], polymer intercalated bentonite for methyl parathion removal [111], Fe3O4 nanoparticles, MOF and polymer constructed core-shell-shell nanospheres for OPPs determination [112]. Functional carbon based polymers have promising application potentials for pesticides removal and determination, but their preparation procedures are relatively complicated and time-consuming.

2.12. Carbon composite
More and more carbon composites have been reported for pesticides removal or determination due to the multifunctional materials integrating introduced synergistic adsorption. After multi-materials hybridization, the effective adsorption sites and functional adsorption groups can be increased, the adsorption affinities can be enhanced, the adsorption ability, adsorption selectively of the hybrid composite can be correspondingly improved. Therefore, construction of carbon composites has become a research hotspot for pesticides extraction. Magnetic carbon materials are a type of significant carbon composite prepared for high-efficiency extraction of pesticides [8]. Besides, many promising materials have been employed for hybridization and application in pesticides removal or determination from polluted water, such as graphene and CNTs [50], graphene and MOF [113], CNTs and MOF [58], C18 and SiO2 [114], and previously mentioned polymer composites. These common carbon composites are illustrated in Fig. 2.

"Abstract
The historical perspective on the rapid biodegradation of pesticides as a mitigating factor in environmental risk assessment is reexamined through the example of glyphosate and its implications for freshwater biodiversity. Commonly employed standardized methods by national agencies for assessing the environmental risk of pesticides predominantly rely on single-species tests, overlooking the intricate nature of ecosystems. Glyphosate, one of the most widely used pesticides marketed for its purported rapid biodegradability, is often perceived as relatively innocuous. However, its degradation releases phosphorus into the environment, inducing a trophic state shift in water systems towards more eutrophic conditions, consequently affecting water quality. These findings highlight the cascading ecological repercussions of glyphosate biodegradation, driving the proliferation of specific aquatic organisms, such as picocyanobacteria and metaphyton, resulting in the alteration of ecosystem structure and dynamics. The study explores challenges posed by commercial pesticide formulations and investigates the consequences of pesticide interactions with specific anthropogenic factors. A case in point is the interaction of glyphosate with the invasive mussel Limnoperna fortunei, exacerbating the overall scenario. The ecological framework analyzed challenges the conventional notion that pesticide biodegradation is inherently a neutral or positive event. The results underscore the necessity of reassessing the role of biodegradation itself in environmental impact assessments for pesticides.

Introduction
Historically, the environmental persistence of contaminants, particularly pesticides, has been considered a critical factor influencing their possible impacts and so their risk assessment [1]. Alarms arise when contaminants exhibit high persistence and/or biomagnification like the DDT [2], while relief comes with rapid dissipation, often through biodegradation. Recently, Maggi et al. [3] have estimated that the major degradation of pesticides, approximately 82%, occurs in the soil through biological mechanisms. This fact seems to be good news about their environmental risk. However, it is imperative to consider whether biodegradation of pesticides truly represents a harmless process for biodiversity. In this paper, we aim to comment why pesticide biodegradation could not be advantageous for the environment.

Generally, studies on the impact of pesticides and their degradation products have primarily focused on laboratory toxicological research, especially on single-species assays. Typically, these trials begin with tests on single-species cultures, overlooking studies of greater complexity such as those involving two or more species or communities with different trophic levels [4]. While these studies are significant, their extrapolation is limited when considering the actual ecological impacts on the environment. How do the direct impacts of both the active ingredients and/or their degradation products affect target and non-target populations in a natural system, where they interact with other populations (e.g., competition, predation) and the abiotic environment? It becomes apparent that indirect impacts in the natural environment can be substantial and may even surpass the direct ones. Most of the existing literature predominantly focuses on biodegradation from a bioremediation perspective or analyzes the toxicity of intermediate products, leaving relatively unexplored the ecological perspective of how pesticide biodegradation itself impacts various aspects of biodiversity.

Biodiversity decline is one of the major global threats in the context of global change. Recently, there has been increased emphasis on studying chemical pollution as a driver of biodiversity decline, underscoring the necessity of adopting a more ecosystem-centered approach for risk assessment. The significance of biodiversity extends beyond its intrinsic value; it serves as a vital source of natural contributions to people, often referred to as ecosystem services, making its preservation crucial. Therefore, there is a pressing need for comprehensive ecosystem studies for risk assessment to better understand and manage the intricate relationships between biodiversity, chemical pollution, and the provisioning of ecosystem services [5].

In the current landscape of global agriculture, pesticides play a pivotal role in pest management, crucial for obtaining crop yields. However, it is worth noting that in conventional industrial production systems, pesticides are not so much enhancing yields as they are necessary for any significant yield at all. The dependence on pesticides is so significant that crop production would be severely compromised without them, particularly due to the reliance of specific crop varieties on these chemicals [6, 7]. Among the most widely employed pesticides, glyphosate stands out as the primary herbicide integrated into the Roundup Ready® soybean—glyphosate technological package and other genetically modified crops. The widespread adoption of this herbicide has reshaped agricultural practices, particularly in soybean cultivation, prompting increased scientific scrutiny into its environmental and human health impacts [8, 9]. Glyphosate's presumed short half-life in soil and water has been viewed as a favorable characteristic, suggesting that it may not pose the same persistence risks as some older pesticide active principles. Nevertheless, the biodegradation of glyphosate reveals alarming negative implications for the environment and overall biodiversity [10, 11]. In particular, it is noteworthy that freshwater systems are heavily impacted by pesticides originating from agricultural activities within their watersheds serving as sinks for the runoff from such activities [12, 13]. The objective of this work is to examine the consequences of glyphosate biodegradation on freshwater systems and to utilize its example to advocate for a paradigm shift in environmental pesticide risk assessment, focusing specifically on the active ingredient glyphosate, irrespective of its various commercial formulations. Here, we discuss the assertion that biodegradability inherently reduces the environmental risk of any pesticide, particularly in terms of its impact on biodiversity and environmental health.

How do we assess pesticides' environmental risk?
To assess pesticide environmental risk and establish guidance levels, governmental entities and national agencies worldwide typically rely on criteria from organizations such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, USA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA, European Union), usually considering the opinions of the World Health Organization´s (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), both from United Nations. Nevertheless, beyond their distinct focus and criteria, the different agencies and authorities in general use the same type of studies for the environmental risk assessment [14].

Globally, environmental pesticide risk assessment is based on two components: (1) the ecological effects and (2) the exposure characterization [15]. The first is based on pesticide's toxicity to several organisms and ecological entities (e.g., communities), using some habitual endpoints under different concentrations or levels. Usually, various standardized toxicity tests, including acute, subacute, and chronic tests, are conducted on key sentinel species measuring endpoints like No Observed Adverse Effect Concentration/Level (NOAEC/L), the concentration causing 50% lethality (LC50), and the concentration/dose producing 50% of the maximal response (EC50/ED50). Assuming that model species adequately represent natural community compositions and sensitivities, tests are conducted on species such as Skeletonema costatum [16], Lemna minor [17], Anabaena flos-aquae [18], Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata [19], and a freshwater diatom (Navicula sp.) [20] for assessing non-target aquatic plant phytotoxicity due to herbicides, while the cladoceran Daphnia magna [21] is standardized for invertebrates. However, the sensitivity of species to contaminants varies significantly, rendering reliance solely on a single non-target test species inadequate for assessing the ecotoxicological risk of pesticides in aquatic biota [22]. To address this limitation, Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA), grounded in species sensitivity distribution, has been proposed as a quantitative alternative for risk evaluation [23, 24]. Despite its merits, PRA may not comprehensively represent real-life aquatic ecosystem responses to pesticide exposure due to its inherent omission of various ecological interactions [25].

Another significant aspect in the environmental risk assessment of pesticides is the exposure characterization. Predicted environmental concentrations are estimated as the ambient concentration of a chemical in the environment. They are typically predicted using exposure models and available data on chemical use, fate, and behavior in the environment [26]. Elevated environmental persistence, typically quantified by long half-lives, is considered a substantial threat, as prolonged exposure periods for organisms heighten the potential for biomagnification [27]. In accordance with guidelines, ecological approaches are only pursued if the predicted environmental concentrations exceed the risk concentrations determined in single-species assays [4, 28]. In these cases, to capture a more ecological framework, ecotoxicological studies have transitioned from controlled laboratory conditions and single-species assays to outdoor mesocosm approaches [29]. However, a considerable number of pesticides have not undergone examination under such conditions, and most of them have been evaluated only as single active ingredients, presenting formidable challenges given the plethora of commercial formulations and environmental mixtures.

In essence, this comment highlights a significant concern: the quick biodegradation of active ingredients leads to reduced anticipated environmental concentrations, thus sidestepping additional ecological assessments. Nonetheless, it is crucial to acknowledge the potential ecological ramifications stemming from this rapid biodegradability itself.

What does glyphosate teach us?
Below this paradigm, the glyphosate's relatively low toxicity in single-species tests and its classification as low persistent pesticide, resulted in some of the highest environmental protection guideline levels among all pesticides. As it was stated above, standardized methods used by national agencies to assess pesticide risks have limitations due to the complexity of ecosystems. To address this, the case of glyphosate illustrates the need for multi-scale analyses. Glyphosate, the world's most widely used herbicide, has been extensively studied in freshwater environments, utilizing microcosms and outdoor mesocosms to mimic ecosystem conditions [30,31,32,33].

Glyphosate is marketed for its purported rapid biodegradability, touted as a property that renders it relatively innocuous. This attribute, emphasizing the efficient breakdown of glyphosate in environmental conditions, contributes to its promotion as a seemingly environmentally friendly herbicide. Glyphosate is a low-molecular-weight phosphonate; upon introduction into water bodies, the fate of glyphosate, like that of any other pesticide, is subject to various factors. The original molecule may be absorbed, complexed, precipitated, or undergo degradation processes such as photolysis, oxidation, hydrolysis or biodegradation [34, 35]. The primary degradation products of glyphosate include aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) and sarcosine [35]. It is noteworthy that documented records suggest the toxicity of these degradation products may surpass that of the original active ingredient [36].

This insight is derived from laboratory studies conducted in monospecific-scale microcosms. In the environment, the ultimate degradation of glyphosate results in the release of phosphorus into the surrounding environment, leading to a shift in the trophic state of water systems towards more eutrophic scenarios with consequential significant changes in the structure and functioning of the ecosystem. Hérbert et al. [37] estimated that the current phosphorus (P) load derived from glyphosate into hydrological basins worldwide is now reaching levels comparable to those from fertilizers. In the USA, it increased from 1.6 kg P/km2 in 1993 to 9.4 kg P/km2 in 2014, with values frequently exceeding 20 kg P/km2 in areas planted with glyphosate-resistant crops. Pérez et al. [30] used 25 m3 outdoor mesocosms to evaluate the effect on aquatic systems of the glyphosate-based formulation Roundup®, demonstrating significant changes in the microbial community structure and function. They demonstrated that the swift biodegradation of glyphosate played a pivotal role yielding diverse effects on autotrophic microbial communities. Glyphosate is known to play as an antibiotic and probably contributes to the direct mortality of some specific algal and cyanobacteria species. Nevertheless, its presence did not result in a reduction in the specific richness of larger phytoplankton (micro?+?nano-phytoplankton) but did lead to a decrease in their abundance, indicating both the mortality of some organisms and a physiological response to herbicide-induced stress, reducing reproduction. In contrast, picocyanobacteria exhibited a 40-fold increase in abundance compared to controls. This phenomenon could be attributed to several factors. Firstly, picocyanobacteria demonstrate the capacity to utilize phosphorus from glyphosate as a nutrient; certain picocyanobacteria possess the ability to break down the phosphonate bond of glyphosate [38]. Secondly, the observed increase could be a result of reduced competition due to the diminished abundance of larger algae, indicating trophic modifications within the community. Alternatively, it could be a combination of both factors acting simultaneously. The introduction of phosphorus into the aquatic system via glyphosate appears to be primarily targeting the biomass of picocyanobacteria.

While possessing the shikimic acid pathway, surviving autotrophic organisms exhibit diverse responses to glyphosate exposure. These responses often involve physiological adaptations such as modifications in gene expression that leads on the synthesis of protective substances [39], or an overproduction of the enzyme EPSP (target of glyphosate in the shikimic metabolic pathway of synthesis of aromatic amino acids). Organisms that withstand glyphosate through these adaptive mechanisms can capitalize on the bio-available phosphorus released from bacterial biodegradation of glyphosate. Phosphorus differential exploitation triggers ecosystem-wide changes, culminating in a significant surge in picocyanobacteria abundance, ultimately leading to a substantial enhancement in the overall phytoplankton primary production and turbidity of water bodies [30, 31].

The key findings resulting from micro- and mesocosm trials, carried out in both laboratory and outdoor conditions, were validated through in situ studies at the landscape scale [40, 41]. The surveys spanned Pampa and Patagonia lakes indicate significant impacts of glyphosate-based herbicides on freshwater microbial communities. Authors found evidence that supports the increased picocyanobacteria abundance in response to long-term glyphosate-based agricultural practices, highlighting the consequential effects on microbial ecosystems.

An ecological study of the environmental risk of a pesticide should also analyze the characteristics of the ecosystems it impacts. The resilience of each system to pesticide exposure is crucial, as their vulnerability varies based on the characteristics of their constituent communities, which ultimately determine their recovery capability [42]. We observed this phenomenon through various tests on clear freshwater systems (low turbidity, mesotrophic) and turbid systems (high organic turbidity, eutrophic), each with distinct planktonic community compositions, comparing the effects using glyphosate [43] and 2,4-D [44]. In both approaches, the impact of pesticides was scenario-dependent, with clear systems exhibiting greater resilience than turbid systems.

Moreover, compounding the complexities delineated hitherto, lies in the utilization of commercial formulations. In the instance of glyphosate, akin to all pesticides, the application in the field comprises a blend encompassing the active ingredient alongside assorted additives and adjuvants, exhibiting variations among commercial brands and even within the same brand across different batches. This intricate variability exacerbates the difficulty in evaluating its impacts. Evidence of this is found in the study conducted by Sabio and García et al. [45], wherein they compared the impacts of five distinct glyphosate-based herbicides, including the monoisopropylamine salt of glyphosate (GIPA), on microbial communities in natural shallow lakes. They observed significantly different effects on the structure of phytoplankton based on the specific glyphosate-based herbicide used, even when the herbicides shared similar active ingredients. Meanwhile, Lipok et al. [33] compared the toxicity of pure glyphosate, GIPA, and isopropylamine salt on various species of algae and cyanobacteria, finding that predominantly isopropylamine alone was more toxic than glyphosate. In general, the composition of additives and coadjuvants in commercial formulations remains largely unknown while salt-compositions are disclosed. These components, in addition to their intrinsic toxicity, may potentially introduce nutrients into the system. Gattás et al. [46] performed a comparative analysis of nutrient levels in water after applying both a commercial glyphosate formulation and the active ingredient. Their study revealed a notable increase in ammonium concentration in the commercial formulation compared to the pure active ingredient.

Finally, in the broader context of global change, the confluence of simultaneous anthropogenic drivers may result in synergistic effects. This is exemplified by the introduction of glyphosate into a system inhabited by the invasive mussel Limnoperna fortunei, which arrived in South America in the 1990s and is now widely distributed throughout the entire estuary basin of the Río de la Plata. Experimental evidence demonstrates that the invasive mussel reduces the half-life of glyphosate by a factor of four, implying a pronounced acceleration of its biodegradation [47]. In experimental outdoor mesocosm conditions, it has been demonstrated that the acceleration of glyphosate biodegradation mediated by the potent degradation capabilities of mussel resulted in the massive development of microalgae forming macroscopic mats (metaphyton) [48] which often float and accumulate in large masses along the shores and eddies of aquatic systems. This community, in turn, represents the fate of phosphorus introduced into the system via glyphosate. These findings underscore the cascading ecological consequences of accelerated glyphosate biodegradation, highlighting the shift towards the proliferation of specific aquatic organisms and the subsequent alteration of the structure and dynamics within the ecosystem.

What insights does glyphosate offer? It highlights that the biodegradation of any pesticide in the environment involves significant and intricate variations that must be ecologically considered on an ecosystem scale. This understanding has been made possible by the extensive research conducted on glyphosate, the world's most applied and studied pesticide, allowing for a comprehensive examination of its effects and contributing to a broader awareness of the complex ecological dynamics associated with pesticide use. All the instances demonstrated by glyphosate contribute to the understanding that it is necessary to conduct ecosystem-level approaches to determine responses and reduce uncertainty regarding the true impact of pesticides on the environment.

Conclusions
The example of glyphosate illustrates that biological degradation is not neutral; rather, organisms involved in the biodegradation process may be favored and have the potential to alter the entire ecosystem based on their roles and behavior. These effects, whether in soil or aquatic environments, could propagate trophically and/or persist over time, potentially altering the overall quality of an ecosystem. It is crucial that environmental risk assessment methods take this factor into account and develop strategies to gain a comprehensive understanding of the actual impact of pesticide biodegradation on the environment. This issue must be supplemented by considering the implications of the fact that what is actually applied in the field is composed of commercial formulations, so the active ingredient plus additives and adjuvants, forming mixtures with varied chemical characteristics, which do not undergo any risk analysis. We understand the urgency of integrating such considerations into risk assessment protocols. Our primary suggestion is to emphasize the need for a comprehensive review of existing risk assessment, highlighting the various aspects currently overlooked that contribute to the significant environmental and public health issues associated with pesticides. It is imperative that risk analyses be approached with a more ecological focus. The example of glyphosate should serve as an alarming signal, as the dominant toxicological perspective in ecotoxicology has consistently underestimated the impacts of pesticides, considered the world's most significant environmental contaminant, over the last two decades. Our intention is to contribute evidence aimed at raising awareness among the scientific community and decision-makers about the necessity of incorporating more ecological approaches on pesticide risk evaluation.

"Abstract
Groundwater pesticide safety management is essential for providing consistently safe water for humans, but such management is limited globally. In this study, we developed an accurate and convenient exposure assessment method for the safety management of pesticides in groundwater by conducting a lysimeter experiment to evaluate the leaching of 11 pesticides into groundwater. During the experimental period, flutoalanil and oxadiazon had the highest cumulative leaching amounts, 603.7 and 83.5 ng, respectively. Comparative analysis of existing groundwater exposure prediction indices, including the GUS, LEACH, modified LEACH, Hornsby index, and GLI showed no correlations with the measured data (p?>?0.05). To enhance the accuracy of the assessment method, we used lysimeter data and principal component analysis to determine the main factors affecting groundwater leaching, and developed the “pesticide groundwater leaching scoring system” (PLS). The soil and water half-life, which had the greatest positive impact on groundwater leaching, was set as a 10-point indicator, whereas log P was set as a 1-point indicator. In contrast, solubility in water was determined as a 5-point indicator, and organic carbon partition coefficient and vapor pressure were determined as 2.5-point indicators owing to their negative relationship. The correlation coefficient was 0.670, indicating a significant correlation with the lysimeter data (p?<?0.05). Using our scoring system, we ranked 376 pesticides. As an exposure assessment method developed using actual data, the PLS is expected to be applicable to groundwater safety management.

Introduction
Pesticides are substances used for pest control in agricultural or forestry products and, depending on the control target, are classified as insecticides (for pest control), fungicides (for plant disease control), and herbicides (for weed removal). As a major agricultural input, they have been used to increase yield and reduce labor in the agricultural environment (Ganiev and Nedorezkov 2006; Klimin 2014). Since the late twentieth century, the use of pesticides has increased, reaching a usage of 4.1 million tons in 2018 (FAO 2022). With the increase in the use of pesticides, various environmental problems, such as impacts on ecosystems and groundwater, have arisen. Residual pesticides in the soil can move vertically and horizontally into the atmosphere, surface water, and groundwater. Currently used pesticides include both polar and non-polar substances with various physical and chemical properties, and some of them have the potential to move through solid media (Navarro et al. 2021). The most representative movement is vertical mobility into groundwater (Ibrahim and Al-Turki 2020). The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) obligatorily evaluates the possibility of a pesticide leaching into groundwater (its soil mobility) during pesticide registration assessments (OECD 2021).

Groundwater accounts for about 30% of global freshwater resources (Morris et al. 2003) and is used worldwide for domestic, industrial, and agricultural purposes (Postigo and Barceló 2015). A thorough management system is required to use water resources sustainably. In many countries, heavy metals, harmful microbes, persistent organic pollutants, and radioactive materials are managed through rigorous monitoring. However, the management of artificially used pesticides varies across countries. The European Union includes pesticide groundwater quality standards, regulating the maximum residual limit of individual pesticides to 0.1 µg L?1, and the total detected pesticides to less than 0.5 µg L?1. In the USA, the Office of Water of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plays a central role in groundwater quality management, with both state and local agencies contributing. After obtaining EPA approval based on the actual conditions in each state, a groundwater conservation plan was established (the Source Water Assessment Program). The EPA generally regulates pesticides in µg/L, managing about 27 pesticides. In Korea, diazinon, parathion, fenitrothion, and carbaryl in drinking water are managed at 0.02, 0.06, 0.04, and 0.07 mg L?1, respectively (Ministry of Environment Korea 2020; Ministry of Food and Drug Safety 2020). However, a system for managing the safety of pesticides in groundwater is lacking. With over 500 registered active pesticide substances, the number of pesticides being managed is insufficient, and uniform safety management measures do not consider the varying toxicity and residual characteristics of pesticides; thus, they are not considered appropriate. Pesticide safety in agricultural products is managed by setting a maximum residue limit for registered active substances, considering the toxicity and residual characteristics of the pesticides (Ahn et al. 2020). However, the current state of the safety management of pesticides in groundwater remains inadequate. To establish a safety management system, elucidation of the causes of pesticide contamination in groundwater, such as monitoring and exposure assessments, should be conducted.

Monitoring research has been conducted to assess the status of pesticide residue in groundwater. Laganà et al. (2002) detected 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) pesticides in irrigation and groundwater in Italy. Haarstad and Ludvigsen (2007) reported that 12 pesticide types, including bentazone, dichlorprop, endosulfan, chlopiralid, MCPA, mecoprop, and 2,4-D, were detected in watersheds across Norway, and especially reported that pesticides from the penoxy acid group were detected at high concentrations. In monitoring studies by Lapworth and Gooddy (2006), diuron was detected at 90% of the groundwater sampling points in the southeastern region of the UK. Various pesticides such as carbendazim, atrazine, MCPA, 2,4-D, diuron, and aniline have been detected in groundwater not only in European countries such as Sweden, Italy, and the UK but also in Asian countries such as South Korea and Japan (Imran and Jain 1998; Laganà et al. 2002; Lapworth and Gooddy 2006; Haarstad and Ludvigsen 2007; Fava et al. 2010; Shaw et al. 2012; Åkesson et al. 2015; Estes et al. 2016). In Korea, butachlor and chlorantraniliprole were detected in river water used for agriculture (Hwang et al. 2019), and carbofuran and alachlor were reported in groundwater monitoring results (Song et al. 2017). Diazonon has been detected in Japan (Syafrudin et al. 2021), endosulfan and butachlor in India (Sackaria and Elango 2020), and bifenthrin and carbofuran in Pakistan (Tariq et al. 2004). Detected pesticide levels differ by country owing to differences in farming activities (Lowder et al. 2016). However, to understand the causes of pesticide contamination, the physical and chemical characteristics of pesticides must be accurately assessed, including a clear exposure-evaluation study on pesticide mobility.

Research evaluating pesticide exposure in groundwater includes a study by Cherrier et al. (2005), who used atrazine in an outdoor environment with a 30-cm soil column installed, and one by Landry et al. (2004), who studied the leaching of diuron using a 20-cm soil column. Park et al. (2020) studied the detection patterns of alachlor, ethoprophos, and carbofuran in simulated leaching experiments in soil from Jeju Island, Korea. Kogan et al. (2007) compared various modeling techniques by creating an actual field instead of a column, and Klier et al. (2008) evaluated the leaching potential of glyphosate using mathematical modeling. Leaching research has primarily been conducted using soil column experiments (Katagi 2013). Although exposure-evaluation, residue-pattern, and half-life assessments have been conducted using disturbed soil, such as soil columns, the soil structure, microporosity, large porosity, and soil???water ratio in such systems differ from those in field soil conditions (Biggar and Nielsen 1976). Therefore, there can be some difficulties in reflecting objective characteristics in the actual field. Research on the mobility evaluation of pesticides using lysimeters, which can directly collect the flow of water and chemical substances inside the soil, has been partially conducted as an alternative (Kordel and Klein 2006). Research using lysimeters has mainly focused on nutrients (Shepherd and Bennett 1998; Meissner et al. 2002; Ulén et al. 2013; Jia et al. 2014), and lysimeter-based research on harmful chemical substances is limited.

The groundwater ubiquity score (GUS) has been widely used as an indicator for the potential evaluation of groundwater exposure to harmful chemical substances. The GUS is an empirical groundwater pesticide detection index that analyzes the characteristics of pesticides detected in groundwater and uses the adsorption coefficient value for the organic matter and half-life of each pesticide in the soil to predict pesticide contamination in groundwater (Gustafson 1989). Since then, various indicators, such as the LIX, LEACH, modified LEACH (MLEACH), Hornsby, LIN, and global leaching (GLI) indices, have been developed for exposure evaluation. However, because they rely heavily on soil half-life and Koc values or use modeling data instead of actual field data, it is difficult for them to reflect the various physical and chemical characteristics of pesticides in the field, or to fully describe vertical mobility. The factors that determine the mobility of residual pesticides in soil include soil half-life, organic carbon–water partition coefficient (Koc), aquatic half-life, solubility, partition coefficient (log P), vapor pressure, and other characteristics (Kim et al. 2005; Park et al. 2020). Therefore, a precise exposure-evaluation method that considers the various physical and chemical characteristics of pesticides is required. The chemical ranking and scoring method (CRS) is a selection technique used in various fields and is a method to determine the priority of specific substances by considering their physical and chemical characteristics (Kim and Park 2022). CRS can be applied to the behavior of various chemical substances such as pesticides, inorganic substances, food, and pharmaceuticals (Choi et al. 2005; Van Asselt et al. 2013), and we propose that it can be applied to the possibility of pesticide leaching by including factors that influence vertical movement. In addition, if the groundwater movement factor is calculated from the physical and chemical characteristics of pesticides using leaching data from lysimeters, the accuracy of pesticide movement prediction and evaluation can be improved.

This study analyzes the physical and chemical characteristics of pesticides, along with their leaching ability (measured using lysimeters), to assess exposure factors such as GUS, perform scoring through principal component analysis (PCA), and ultimately propose a new quantitative method for evaluating vertical pesticide mobility that reflects field conditions.

Material and methods
Selection and classification of pesticides by GUS
Eleven pesticides were used in this study: butachlor, carbosulfan, chlorpyrifos-methyl, fenobucarb, tricyclazole, iprobenfos, isoprothiolane, oxadiazon, tiadinil, clothianidin, and flutolanil. These pesticides were selected based on their physicochemical characteristics, such as soil and aquatic half-lives, Koc, solubility in water, and GUS, which influence their vertical mobility (Table S1). The 11 pesticides were grouped using GUS, a representative index that indicates the groundwater leaching score (Table 1). The GUS was used to divide the pesticides into three groups: GUS???2.8 indicates high leachability, 1.8–2.8 indicates a transition state, and?<?1.8 indicates low leachability. The factors used in the GUS are the half-life and Koc. In the GUS formula, A is the half-life of the pesticide, which is the time (days) for the pesticide to halve, and B is the Koc, the adsorption coefficient of the chemical (Eq. 1).

Undisturbed soil lysimeter composition and soil properties
The lysimeter used in this study was a standard cylinder with a surface area of 1 m2, height of 1.5 m, and weight of 1541.04 kg. It was a comparative lysimeter that was excavated without disturbing the integrity of the field soil, maintaining the soil characteristics depending on the soil texture and depth (Fig. S1). The soils at the excavation sites were loam (Jeollabuk-do Jeonju-si, latitude 35.939177, longitude 126.992900) and sandy loam (Jeollabuk-do Jeonju-si, latitude 35.895728, longitude 127.069685). Following soil excavation, soil physicochemical properties were analyzed based on agricultural science and technology research and investigation standards. The freely draining water passing through the soil layers was measured using a device (tipping counter, UGT, Münchenburg, Germany) that counted the frequency per 100 mL of drainage over a designated period.

Lysimeter experiment
The lysimeter experiment was conducted using two lysimeters collected from different regions, and no replicates were performed in this study. To assess the relative vertical movement of a substance during testing, it is necessary to use non-adsorptive, nondegradable polar materials with constant movement in the field. In this study, bromide was used as a tracer to track the flow of water in the lysimeter, following the recommendations for substances such as tritium, bromide, fluorescein, and eosin in the OECD guidelines for the testing of chemicals. Regular detection of bromide over time confirmed that there was no irregularity in the water flow (Fig. 2). The test period for the lysimeter was set from June 26 to November 1, 2015, to coincide with the rice cultivation period. Rice transplantation was conducted on June 22, and cultivation on October 30. For pesticide application, each pesticide was dissolved in 1 L of water according to the active ingredient concentration specified by the manufacturer. The application method involved spraying each pesticide sequentially, waiting until the surface moisture had completely dried before applying the next pesticide. This procedure was conducted over a total period of 3 days. Pesticides were applied at a concentration of 5 mg/kg, targeting the soil surface layer (15 cm depth). Water supply began 1 day after spraying, and to simulate actual rice cultivation conditions, the water height was maintained by supplying 5–30 L of water daily, considering the amount of leachate and evaporation. During the study period, leachate samples were collected weekly to determine cumulative leachate volumes. Over this period, the total volume of water leached was 575 L for sandy loam and 695 L for loam soil.

Analysis of pesticides in water
The experiment was performed using a liquid–liquid extraction method. The leachate (500 mL) was placed in a separatory funnel, and 5 mL of saturated NaCl and 150 mL of dichloromethane were added and shaken at a consistent speed. The dichloromethane layer was then passed through sodium sulfate, following concentration in a rotary vacuum evaporator (EYELA MG-2200) heated to 40 ?. After concentrating the sample solvents, 5 mL of acetone was added, and the sediment redissolved. The redissolved sample was then filtered through a syringe filter (0.45 ?m) and analyzed using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (Agilent 6410 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer) (Table 2). The pesticide standard was purchased from Dr. Ehonestorfer GmbH (Agsburg, Germany), dichloromethane was purchased from J.T. Baker (New Jersey, USA), and acetonitrile was purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).

Assessment of pesticide leaching by various indices
The oxidative transformation of procymidone and 3,5-DCA was evaluated using the MMS and ?-MnO2-mediator system (?-MMS) under optimal reaction conditions. The leaching of the 11 pesticides was also assessed using five prominently developed models: LIX, MLEACH, the Hornsby index, LIN, and GLI. LIX is similar to GUS, in that it allows for easy prediction and rapid interpretation of the results by substituting parameters (Spadotto 2002). K denotes the decay constant (1/day) and Koc is presented as mL/g organic carbon (Eq. 2).

(2)
The LEACH index predicts the degree of groundwater pollution by considering the mobility of pesticides (Laskowski et al. 1982). The residual amount of pesticides in the soil water triggers their movement in the soil. The parameters include Sw, which represents the solubility in water (mg/L), DT50 which represents the degradation half-life in soil (days), Vp which represents the vapor pressure (Pa), and Koc (mL/g organic carbon) (Eq. 3).

(3)
Furthermore, to avoid duplicate values when using both the half-life and vapor pressure of pesticides, MLEACH was developed to improve LEACH (Papa et al. 2004). MLEACH is the ratio of the product of the water solubility and half-life to the adsorption coefficient and is calculated as the product of two indices without main components or constants (Eq. 4).

(4)
The Hornsby index is a prediction index for pesticide leaching that considers only the Koc and half-life of the pesticides (Hornsby 1992; Chatupote and Panapitukkul 2005). The lower the Hornsby value, the higher the possibility of the pesticide leaching into groundwater (Eq. 5).

(5)
The leaching index (LIN) was introduced to rank the leaching of pesticides using PCA to assess their physical and chemical properties (Gramatica and Di Guardo 2002). The larger the LIN value of the pesticide, the higher the possibility of leaching into groundwater (Eq. 6).

(6)
where Sw represents the solubility in water (mg/L), Koc is the organic carbon sorption coefficient (mL/g organic carbon), Kow is the octanol–water partition coefficient, and KH is Henry’s constant (atm m3/mol).

The GLI combines three indices (GUS, LEACH, and LIN) (Papa et al. 2004). The formula obtained using PCA is used to select and prioritize potentially polluting pesticides and to predict the possibility of pesticide leaching (Eq. 7).

(7)
PCA of leaching quantity
Most existing indices for pesticide leaching are based on soil half-life and Koc, necessitating the inclusion of various physical and chemical properties of pesticides that determine mobility to enhance accuracy. As the proportion of groundwater exposure varies depending on the characteristics of the pesticide, it is necessary to select the main factors. An effective method for this is PCA. PCA is a statistical method that linearly transforms observations of multiple variables, which may have mutual correlations, to produce new values called principal components. PCA is used to determine the main factors affecting the data. The data used to derive the main factors of groundwater exposure included six pesticide characteristics known to affect their movement in the environment (soil and water system half-life, Koc, log P, vapor pressure, and solubility in water), and the lysimeter-based cumulative leaching results of the 11 pesticides. The principal components were determined as those with eigenvalues of 1.0 or higher. PCA was performed using the JPM statistical program (JMP 10.0.0. SAS Institute Inc.).

Results and discussion
Recovery results
The linearity of the calibration curves for the test pesticides demonstrated satisfactory results, with R2 values exceeding 0.99. The quantification limit for the 11 test pesticides was set at 0.01 ?g/L, referring to previous monitoring studies. To verify the validity of the test pesticides, their recovery rates were analyzed. The average recovery rate was 71.8–115.5%, with a relative standard deviation below 20% in samples with added concentrations of 0.01 and 0.1 ?g/L, indicating that the analytical process was appropriate (n?=?3).

Comparison of leaching in different soils
During the lysimeter test period, the cumulative leaching of flutolanil was the highest of the 11 pesticides, at 542.8–664.5 ng, followed by oxadiazon at 29.8–137.2 ng. Seven pesticides, including clothianidin, showed low leaching amounts (<?1 ng) in all soil types, indicating varying results among the different pesticides (Fig. 1). Furthermore, it was confirmed that the pesticide leaching amount differed depending on the soil type. Of the 11 test pesticides, the leaching amounts of 10 pesticides, excluding isoprothiolane, were high in the loamy soil. The soil leaching potential (SLP) (Weber and Keller 2018; Demir et al. 2019), an index for evaluating leaching potential depending on soil characteristics (Table 2), is a model that predicts the speed of substance movement according to the soil type. A higher value indicates a higher possibility of leaching. The SLP was higher for the loamy soil (SLP, 114) than for the sandy loam soil (SLP, 96) (Table S2). The SLP is defined as the sum of the organic matter content, soil type, and pH, with more than 50% weight assigned to the organic matter content. A lower organic matter content implies a higher possibility of leaching. In the lysimeter soil of this study, the organic matter content was 1.2% higher in the sandy loam soil than in the loamy soil at 1.5 m. In environments with high organic matter content, the solubility of compounds in soil water decreases and a high adsorption environment is created, lowering the possibility of leaching and potentially increasing Koc (Ahangar et al. 2008). The high leaching in the loamy soil was considered a result of the difference in the total organic matter content in the lysimeter soil. However, the movement of substances in the soil is also influenced by various environmental factors, such as rainfall and microbes.

Correlation with GUS-calculated cumulative leaching amounts
GUS is the most representative method for predicting pesticide leaching into groundwater. We analyzed the correlation between the cumulative leaching amount of the 11 test pesticides and GUS as well as the groundwater movement pattern of the pesticides according to the GUS groups (Fig. 2). The GUS index groups pesticides into three classes: high leachability, transition state, and low leachability, and evaluates the leaching amount accordingly. The two pesticides classified as high leachability, tricyclazole and clothianidin, had actual cumulative leaching amounts of 1.31 and 0.16 ng, respectively, ranking fourth and eighth. These results demonstrate the substantial difference between the first and second GUS rankings and first and second lysimeter rankings. Tricyclazole and clothianidin, with soil half-lives of 13–305 and 47–213 days and Koc values of 123 and 169, respectively, had high residuality and low adsorption, yielding high GUS scores in the Pesticide Properties Database (PPDB). However, these two pesticides contain an amino group (N–H) in their molecular structures, which can form cationic species depending on the environmental pH. Because the soil surface is negatively charged, cationic molecules are known to have high soil adsorption capability (Koskinen and Harper 1990). Because both pesticides are amines, and GUS does not account for such chemical structures, the results differed.

The pesticides classified as transition states, flutolanil, oxadiazon, and tiadinil, had cumulative leaching amounts of 603.7, 83.5, and 0.03 ng, ranking first, second, and tenth, respectively. This differed significantly from their GUS rankings of third, fourth, and sixth. Flutolanil, with a soil half-life of 60–170 days and Koc of 457–1340, has a GUS of 2.29 in the PPDB. However, applying the maximum soil half-life and minimum Koc values can increase the leachability of GUS. The soil absorption constant (K) of flutolanil in paddy soils has been reported to be 8, indicating low adsorption (Uchida et al. 1982). The soil used in this study was sandy loam and loamy soil, both low in organic matter and clay content, which may have increased the leaching amount of pesticides such as flutolanil, which are affected by soil type. Oxadiazon has a high adsorption coefficient, with a Koc of 3200; however, it has a half-life of 90–300 days. Mendes et al. (2014) reported that the vertical migration speed of oxadiazole varies depending on the physical and chemical properties of the soil. Similar to oxadiazon, flutolanil is assumed to have a quick leaching speed in sandy loam and loamy soil conditions. Flutolanil and oxadiazon, with log P values of 3.17 and 5.33, respectively, are near non-polar and have low water solubility. After pesticide application, unabsorbed pesticides of this type may rapidly move to large voids and cracks owing to their low water solubility in soil voids (Vereecken 2005). Tiadinil has a short soil half-life of 2–30 days, but also a low Koc of 390. Although it was included in the transition state with a GUS of 2.1 (Tsubata et al. 2006; Food Safety Commission of Japan 2020), it is expected to have a higher degradation speed than groundwater movement owing to its low residual stability.

The low-leachability group mostly exhibited low leaching amounts (isoprothiolane, 4.25 ng; fenobucarb, 0.72 ng; butachlor, 0.55 ng; carbosulfan, 0.27 ng; chlorpyrifos-methyl, 0.15 ng; and iprobenfos, 0.01 ng). Excluding clothianidin and tiadinil, the ranking of the cumulative leaching amounts in the lysimeter was mostly consistent with the GUS ranking, which was lower. The pesticides that ranked the lowest, except for chlorpyrifos-methyl, had soil half-lives of?<?40 days. Chlorpyrifos-methyl has a soil half-life of 100 days but a high Koc of 4645, indicating low mobility.

Analysis of the correlation between the cumulative leaching amount of the test pesticides in the lysimeter and the GUS ranking showed a correlation coefficient of 0.455, which was not statistically significant (p?>?0.05, Fig. 3). It seems that GUS is accurate for evaluating pesticides with extremely low groundwater leaching potential, such as those with low soil half-lives and high Koc values. However, a more accurate evaluation method is required for pesticides with high groundwater leaching potential. Although soil half-life and Koc are the main factors determining the mobility of pesticides, for a more accurate evaluation, various pesticide properties, such as water half-life, water solubility, log P, and vapor pressure, should be considered simultaneously to improve accuracy.

Leaching evaluation by various leaching indices
As mentioned in this study, many research efforts have been made to improve the GUS. The comparison results of the five existing groundwater exposure prediction indices and the ranking of the cumulative leaching amounts in the lysimeter are listed in Table 3. The correlations (r) of the Hornsby index and LIX with the lysimeter cumulative leaching rankings were equivalent, at 0.436, whereas those of GLI, MLEACH, and LIN were 0.200, 0.170, and 0.136, respectively (Table 3).

Table 3 Correlation of test pesticide lysimeter cumulative leaching amount rank with five leaching index ranks
Full size table
LIX and the Hornsby index, which both consider pesticide properties such as soil half-life and Koc value, showed stronger correlations with the actual leaching data than the other indices. These two formulas are similar to GUS, although there was no significant correlation (r?=?0.455) between GUS and the measured values. However, other pesticide characteristics, such as Sw, Vp, water half-life, and log P, also play a role in determining the potential for groundwater leaching. Isoprothiolane had a high Koc, ranking seventh and eighth in LIX and the Hornsby index, respectively; however, its actual leaching rank was third (Table S3). Therefore, other pesticide characteristics that determine groundwater leaching must be considered.

In MLEACH, the soil half-life and Koc of pesticides with high solubility, such as tricyclazole and clothianidin, are influenced, resulting in higher potential leaching than the actual leaching amount. Oxadiazon has a high Koc value regardless of the soil half-life and solubility, resulting in low leaching potential. As there are three characteristics considered for each pesticide, if one value is substantially higher than the other two, the result may differ from the actual leaching value. GLI includes the results calculated using LIN, GUS, and MLEACH and does not directly consider the characteristics of the pesticide. As the three formulas include common soil half-life and Koc values for the pesticides, leading to duplicated calculations, pesticides with a low correlation with the actual leaching amount may have amplified errors.

For LIN, PCA was used to select the main factors determining the leaching amount by considering the five physical and chemical characteristics of the pesticide and assigning weights. The main factor determining the mobility of the pesticide, the soil half-life, was missing, and the Sw value was the factor with the greatest positive relationship in determining the leaching potential. This is considered insufficient to represent the possibility of groundwater leaching in a positive relationship. Tiadinil has a soil half-life of 2.4 days, so it is considered to have low stability in soil; however, when calculating LIN, the leaching potential was high because of the high Sw. LIN is a formula based on modeling and is considered to show weak correlations with actual data (Gramatica and Di Guardo 2002).

Various groundwater leaching prediction formulas considering characteristics other than soil half-life and Koc have been developed without using actual data, and there were differences between their predictions and the cumulative lysimeter leaching amount data. Based on previous research, a groundwater leaching evaluation method that considers pesticide characteristics and reflects actual leaching data is necessary.

PCA by leaching amount
A PCA was conducted to identify the main factors influencing pesticide leaching potential. The PCA results showed two principal components with eigenvalues exceeding 1 (2.71 and 1.89; Fig. 4). Principal components 1 (38.8%) and 2 (27.1%) account for 65.6% of the variance, indicating a significant correlation. Component 1 was characterized by positive associations with soil and aquatic half-lives (0.47 and 0.57, respectively) and negative associations with Koc and log P (??0.35 and???0.39, respectively). Component 2 was positively associated with log P (0.45) and negatively associated with vapor pressure and water solubility (??0.60). The determining factors were computed by summing the product of the eigenvector values and the eigenvalue percentages of the components, as listed in Table 4. In terms of positive relationships, water half-life (0.22) showed a stronger relationship than soil half-life (0.18), and for negative relationships, solubility in water (??0.18) showed a stronger relationship than Koc (??0.14) and vapor pressure (??0.14), which were equivalent. Log P demonstrated opposite relationships for components 1 and 2. Therefore, the summed results converged to 0. Soil and water half-lives are indicators of residual persistence. Larger values imply longer residual periods of pesticides in the environment, thus increasing the potential for stable migration into groundwater (Guo et al. 2015; Kumar and Singh 2019). As such, it is plausible that these factors showed higher values than the other characteristics in determining positive groundwater leaching potential. Koc, an indicator of pesticide adsorption to soil, restricts pesticide mobility as it increases; it binds the pesticide strongly to the soil and inactivates it, thereby decreasing the groundwater leaching potential (Chiou et al. 1979). Consequently, Koc had a negative relationship with groundwater mobility. Solubility contributes to the mobility",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Abstract
The European Union (EU) has set forth ambitious political objectives aimed at mitigating the adverse impacts of agriculture on climate, environment, and human health. Among the measures which are expected to help reach the goals, an important objective is significant reduction of pesticide usage, as outlined in the EU’s ”From Farm to Fork” strategy. This study seeks to assess the potential financial implications of the reduction of pesticide use, focusing on the major crops cultivated in Latvia. Scenario simulations have been conducted to examine the consequences of pesticide usage intensity on profitability, yields, and consumption of fertilisers. The evaluation encompasses winter and spring wheat, along with winter rapeseed, which account for 80% of the total pesticide usage in Latvia. It is assumed that farmers continue to produce the same crops, using their current level of knowledge and adjusting production technology to the reduced pesticides application rates. The analysis leads to the conclusion that in order to attain a reduction in pesticide use by 61% from the 2021 level (or 53% from the 2015–2017 level), the application rate of pesticides needs to be limited to 0.78 kg ha ?1 of active substance for conventionally produced winter and spring wheat as well as winter rapeseed, and in addition to that the area used for these crops should be reduced by 33% (replaced with organic production). However, if the market prices of crops, the amount of public support and production costs do not change, the financial implications for the agricultural sector could be severe — yearly farm profit in the analysed sector could decrease by 41% or by EUR 130 mln.

1. Introduction
Heated debates concerning the reduction of pesticide use are currently underway in many EU countries. On one hand, ambitious EU pesticide reduction targets aim to mitigate the negative impact of widespread pesticide use. On the other hand, there is resistance from the agricultural sector, which questions the rationale behind these EU ambitions; however, such resistance is primarily rooted in financial concerns. This study aims to assess the financial implications of reducing pesticide use on crop producers if they continue to use well-established conventional production technologies.

Pesticides are traditionally used in agricultural production to protect crops against pests and diseases, playing an essential role in maintaining plant health and overall food security in the EU (European Commission, 2020b, Jess et al., 2018). Use of pesticides in various areas results in high crop yields and increases the viability of farms (Tudi et al., 2021), simplifies crop production systems and provides the possibility to abandon complex crop protection strategies (Barzman et al., 2015, Giuliano et al., 2016, Meissle et al., 2010). As a result, pesticides have become an essential means for increasing crop yields through plant protection (Meissle et al., 2010, Sharma et al., 2019). The advantages of using pesticides involve the direct benefits related to plant protection, but there are also secondary benefits related to higher incomes of the farmers, such as use of additional revenues for educational purposes of farm owners and employees (Aktar et al., 2009).

However, many studies identify negative implications of pesticide use on soil, water, air, the environment, biodiversity, and human health (Serebrennikov et al., 2020, European Commission, 2020b, Böcker et al., 2019, Lechenet et al., 2017, Pergner and Lippert, 2023, Lee et al., 2019). For this reason, several important initiatives have been developed by the European Commission as part of the European Green Deal, including the “From Farm to Fork” (F2F) strategy (Triantafyllidis et al., 2023, Schebesta and Candel, 2020). The F2F strategy envisages ambitious and specific targets to be achieved by 2030. These targets include a 50% reduction in the overall use of pesticides, a 50% reduction in the use of more hazardous pesticides, a 20% decrease in fertiliser use, and an increase in the area under organic cultivation to reach at least 25% (König and Araújo-Soares, 2023, Tataridas et al., 2022, Silva et al., 2022, McGinley et al., 2023). This policy document requires farmers to transform conventional production techniques and use nature-based, technologically advanced and digital solutions to achieve better climate- and environment-friendly results; strengthen the resilience of sectors to climate change and reduce the use of production resources, e.g. pesticides and fertilisers (European Commission, 2020a). Sustainable management of natural resources as well as higher productivity and stable food supplies at affordable prices are among the long-term goals of the Common Agricultural Policy of the EU. Yet, agricultural experts and researchers as well as farmers anticipate a significant negative economic impact resulting from the F2F strategy’s goal of halving the use of pesticides (Alexoaei et al., 2022, Pergner and Lippert, 2023, Schebesta and Candel, 2020, Vos et al., 2022); (Muniz-Junior et al., 2023).

The world population is growing and becoming wealthier, and both factors are contributing to the increasing demand for food. As the global population expands, the intensification and industrialisation of agriculture to meet the growing demand for food creates both opportunities and challenges for food security and safety (Fung et al., 2018, Gaba et al., 2016, Carvalho, 2017). Some researchers have found that limiting the use of pesticides and fertilisers could reduce agricultural productivity and create pressure to further expand agricultural land areas (Vos et al., 2022). Others are not so convinced, suggesting that new crop varieties providing higher yields, advanced pesticides and modern agricultural machinery are important factors that significantly affect crop yields and food security (Sane et al., 2021). Also, there is hope that efficient and circular production systems based on the complete use of resources as well as food waste reduction could help in the future (Serebrennikov et al., 2020), expecting that avoidance of food waste could increase the potential to reduce the environmental impacts of food consumption by up to 75% (Von Ow et al., 2020).

At the farm level, reducing pesticide usage will pose various technological and financial challenges, complicating the situation for crop producers who are already dealing with significant risks associated with weather, the volatility of crop prices and costs of production resource. It seems that for the widespread reduction of pesticide use there should be a support system, for instance to compensate the reduction in yields (Mack et al., 2023) or profits. However, there are often risks and uncertainties about whether the support system will be adequate. It also seems that for large-scale adoption of pesticide-free production technologies, the set of policies should go beyond just financial incentives and should include awareness (Finger and Möhring, 2022) and spillover effect (Wang et al., 2023). A comprehensive approach is essential, as many pesticide reduction schemes have failed to achieve their usage reduction goals (Möhring et al., 2020), but each unsuccessful attempt can result in negative financial consequences for farmers.

The use of pesticides in agriculture is a habit that is difficult to eliminate. Farmers have used them as the main resource in agricultural production, and traditional knowledge about and skills in combating pests and diseases have often been lost (Alexoaei et al., 2022). Since a conventional production system has been developed over many decades, is scalable and well-known by crop producers, it is worthwhile to analyse the consequences if farmers continue to use the same conventional production technology while reducing pesticide usage.

This study has three main objectives: (1) it aims to evaluate the potential impact of pesticide use reduction on the profitability of the crop sector in Latvia; (2) it seeks to assess the effect of pesticide use reduction on the usage of synthetic fertilisers; (3) it aims to evaluate the influence of these changes on the overall volume of crop production.

Three policy scenarios are used to evaluate the impact of pesticide use reduction to understand the necessary scope of policy to achieve the F2F pesticide use reduction goal. For the first policy scenario, pesticide use intensity is reduced to a maximum of 1.35 kg of active substance per hectare. For the second scenario, it is further reduced to a maximum of 0.78 kg per hectare. The most ambitious policy scenario not only aims to decrease pesticide use intensity to 0.78 kg but also involves converting 33% of the wheat and winter rapeseed areas to organic farming. Calculations are conducted using crop production technology models, which describe interrelations between pesticide inputs, fertiliser inputs, yields and profits.

2. Crop production in Latvia
The future of plant protection is an important topic for many countries, including Latvia. Projected climate scenarios with increased temperature and precipitation in the region could lead to an increase in weed invasions, plant diseases and insect pests, leading to changes in agricultural practices (Mentzel et al., 2022).

Latvia, a country in the northern part of Europe, has approximately 2 million hectares of utilised agricultural area. Grasslands and forage crops for the livestock sector cover approximately 45% of this area, while less than 2% is used to produce fruits, berries, and vegetables. The remainder is primarily used for cultivating cereals, rapeseed, and pulses in rotation, with wheat and winter rapeseed being the dominant crops. Generally, if soil and crop rotation conditions allow, winter rapeseed and winter wheat are cultivated on farms in Latvia due to their profitability (Auzins et al., 2023). Wheat and rapeseed are primarily cultivated using conventional production technology, with organic farming accounting for just over 2% of the cultivated area.

According to FADN data, the crop sector in Latvia generates half of the agricultural sector’s profit, and any financial impact on wheat and rapeseed production will have significant implications for the entire agricultural sector.

The cultivation of wheat and winter rapeseed has a major impact on pesticide usage. According to our assessment which is based on national pesticide use statistics (Central Statistical Bureau of Latvia, 2023a) and crop area data (Central Statistical Bureau of Latvia, 2023b), wheat and winter rapeseed account for approximately 80% of the total pesticide use in Latvia. The expansion of wheat and rapeseed cultivation over the past decade has also resulted in a 30% increase in pesticide use within this group during the period from 2015–2017 until 2021. Furthermore, there is potential for further growth in the wheat cultivation area in the coming years (Pilvere et al., 2022).

Currently, the F2F strategy pesticide use reduction target is set only for the EU as a whole, and at the moment of the preparation of this study, specific goals for each EU member state were not precisely defined. For this reason, the study analyses the impact of one of the draft proposals, which aims to achieve 53% pesticides use reduction by 2030 compared to the levels recorded between 2015 and 2017 (European Commission, 2022). Considering the increase in pesticide use since 2015–2017, this goal is to achieve a 61% reduction in pesticide use from the 2021 level.

3. Materials and methods
3.1. Definitions
To ensure clarity and consistency in terminology, the following assumptions have been made: (a) in this article, the terms “pesticides” and “plant protection products” are used interchangeably; (b) pesticides refer only to substances used in agriculture, excluding those used for non-agricultural purposes, such as biocides; (c) when referring to pesticides which are not allowed in organic farming, some stakeholders use the term “chemical pesticides”, while others use “synthetic pesticides”. In this article, the term “pesticides” is used to specifically denote those that cannot be used in organic farming; (d) stakeholders such as policymakers, statistical offices, and others use the terms “mineral fertilisers” and “synthetic fertilisers” interchangeably, all with the same meaning. In this article, the term “fertilisers” is used to specifically refer to mineral/synthetic fertilisers.

3.2. Effect of different pesticides application rates
The study was performed by comparing various production alternatives used in cultivation of winter wheat, spring wheat and winter rapeseed in Latvia. To describe different production alternatives with different pesticide inputs, crop production technology models were used (LLKC, 2021a). Crop production technology models are developed by a team of agricultural consultants from the Latvian Rural Advisory and Training Centre (LLKC), the leading organisation? providing agricultural consultancy services in Latvia. Models have been validated through testing conducted on 10 commercial farms and test fields at the Institute of Agricultural Resources and Economics.

The crop production technology models list in detail what kind of pesticides and fertilisers could be optimally used for various crop production technologies to achieve various target yields. These models are calculated based on the assumption of a soil pH of 6, as well as average levels of phosphorus and potassium in the soil. The models also include costs and revenue, but within this study we supplemented them with rent paid for land and administrative costs in their expense sections. Short versions of the crop production technology models used in this research are found in Appendix A of this study.

However, it is worth noting that the models employed in the study do not address specific issues such as plant disease outbreaks and may slightly underestimate the necessity of pesticide use.

The profit is estimated using constant prices (selling prices of crop products and purchase prices of the means of agricultural production) of the respective crops and production technologies in Latvia in 2021, e.g. the price of food-grade wheat was 210 EUR t?1, the price of rapeseed was 500 EUR t?1. Conventional production and ploughing technology are used for production. Although a significant increase in prices and costs was reported in 2022, it is assumed that 2022 was an exceptional year, affected by several extraordinary factors, and in the medium-term, price-to-cost ratios would be close to 2021 levels.

In the EU, chemical active substances of pesticides are classified into four groups (European Commission, 2022). Group 1 consists of approved low-risk chemical active substances, Group 2 includes other approved chemical active substances, Group 3 comprises chemical active substances approved as candidates for substitution, and Group 4 includes unapproved chemical active substances. Each group is assigned different hazard weightings, with values of 1, 8, 16, and 64 for Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Chemical active substances can be moved between groups, which may result in changes to their hazard weightings in either direction. It is worth noting that in the calculations, the pesticides’ active substances were not multiplied by the pesticides’ risk group coefficients. This minimally affects the calculation results, as almost all active substances included in the crop production technology models belong to risk group 2. Yet, the used approach allows comparison with national statistical data.

Table 1 summarises the information from the crop production technology models (see Appendix A) for winter wheat, summer wheat, and winter rapeseed. It presents the optimal use of pesticides and fertilisers required to achieve target yields, and it also shows the expected profit. The table illustrates that in conventional production reducing the pesticide application rate will shift the target yield while also reducing both the use of fertilisers and expected profit.

The calculation results presented in Table 1 show, for example, that a winter wheat yield of 5 t ha ?1 requires, on average, a pesticides active substance of 1.35 kg ha ?1, which results in an expected average profit of 463 EUR ha ?1.

3.3. Effect of conversion from conventional to organic production
One option for reducing the usage of chemical pesticides in crop production analysed in this study is to transition from conventional to organic production. In this case, the pesticides on which our study is focused (see Section 3.1) will not be used at all.

According to Gross Margin calculations for different crops (LLKC, 2021b), this transition results in reduced profits. In this study, it is assumed that, on average, for winter wheat, this leads to a profit reduction of 272 EUR per hectare. For summer wheat, a profit reduction of 124 EUR per hectare is expected, while for winter rapeseed producers, switching from conventional to organic farming will result in a profit reduction of 387 EUR per hectare.

3.4. Policy simulations
Scenario simulation approach is used to assess pesticide usage reduction policies. Initially, within the baseline scenario, current pesticide use and profit by crop and yield is calculated. After that, pesticide use and profits are calculated for the policy scenarios. Policy impact is evaluated as the difference between policy scenario and the baseline scenario.

Policy scenarios are focused on reduction of pesticide use intensity. Considering that winter wheat is economically the most significant crop in the country and has the highest pesticide use intensity compared to spring wheat and rapeseed, pesticide use intensity reduction targets are set based on pesticide use thresholds specific to winter wheat (see Table 1).

For the first policy scenario, pesticide use intensity is reduced to 1.35 kg of active substance per hectare, which corresponds to the target winter wheat yield of 5 tons per hectare.

For the second policy scenario, pesticide use intensity is reduced to 0.78 kg of active substance per hectare, which corresponds to the target winter wheat yield of 4 tons per hectare.

More ambitious pesticide use intensity limitations will be below the lowest threshold, abolishing any conventional wheat production. For this reason, even lower pesticide use limitations are not included as a scenario. It is assumed that to reduce pesticide use even further, it should be regulated by reducing conventional area for agriculture. For this reason, the most ambitious policy scenario envisions not only reducing pesticide use intensity to 0.78 kg, but also converting 33% of the wheat and winter rapeseed areas to organic farming. The 33% increase is above the 25% objective of the F2F strategy, assuming that the area of organic grasslands and forage crops for the livestock sector will remain at the current level and the crop sector will carry the entire burden of this F2F objective.

4. Results
This chapter presents the research findings. The baseline scenario is presented in Section 3.1, while Section 3.2 explores the results of the policy scenarios.

4.1. Baseline scenario
For the baseline scenario, all areas under winter wheat, spring wheat and winter rapeseed in Latvia were divided into yield categories (Table 2). For instance, the total area under winter wheat with an average yield of 5 t ha ?1 (from 4.5 to 5.5 t ha ?1) in 2021 was 119,025 ha, the spring wheat area being 6568 ha and the winter rapeseed area being 1681 ha. This allows us to evaluate total pesticide usage by crop and yield and to later use this information for the policy simulations, introducing pesticide usage limitations.

To identify the total consumption of pesticides and NPK fertilisers as well as farm profits, the crop areas with different yields (Table 2) were multiplied by the application rates needed to get a respective yield (Table 1). The calculation results are presented in Table 3. For example, a total of 160.1 tonnes of pesticide active substances and a total of 15.4 thou. tonnes of N fertiliser were needed for winter wheat areas with a yield of 5 t ha ?1, thereby making profits of EUR 55.2 mln. in this yield group alone.

A total was calculated by adding up the respective figures for winter wheat, spring wheat and winter rapeseed (Table 3). Therefore, under the baseline scenario, the totals for producing winter wheat, spring wheat and winter rapeseed were as follows:

As already mentioned in Section 3.2, the calculation results for the baseline scenario do not precisely reflect the actual use of pesticides and NPK fertilisers. The difference can be explained by the limitations of the crop technological models, which do not take into account the specific challenges of each farm, and the less efficient use of pesticides compared to what is proposed by the crop technological models. Nevertheless, the results for this base scenario are close enough to be considered valid — based on calculations derived from statistical data, national pesticide use in 2021 was approximately 900 tonnes of active substance.

4.2. Policy scenarios
To assess the impacts of potential pesticide use intensity reduction, it is assumed that all farms currently applying pesticides above the limitations defined in the scenarios will adjust their target yield to comply with pesticide use limitations. The impact of pesticide use intensity limitations varies for different crops, as described below.

Winter wheat. By introducing the pesticide usage limitations for winter wheat as defined in the scenarios, two new maximum yield thresholds have been determined (can be seen in Fig. 1a) . The first threshold is set at a maximum pesticide use intensity of 1.35 kg ha ?1, corresponding to maximum of 5 tons per hectare yield. The second threshold is set at a maximum pesticide use intensity of 0.78 kg ha ?1, corresponding to maximum of 4 tons per hectare.

This reduction in target yields will result in the reduction of pesticide use and will also lead to a decrease in the usage of N, P and K fertilisers (Figs. 1b and 1c). The level of expected profit of winter wheat producers will also be reduced (Fig. 1d).

Spring wheat. The yields of spring wheat are not expected to be affected by the reduction in the intensity of pesticide use under Scenario 1 (Fig. 2a). At the reduction of maximum pesticide use intensity to 1.35 kg ha ?1, there is no impact on the maximum target yield, as spring wheat requires a smaller quantity of pesticides. However, the reduction of maximum pesticide use intensity to 0.78 kg ha ?1 has a significant impact, allowing on average no more than to 3 t ha ?1. It should also be noted that in the case of 0.78 limitation, the pesticide application rate for this group of crops could be reduced even below 0.78 kg ha ?1, as the optimal crop production technology allows farmers to achieve this target yield at a smaller application rate of 0.06 kg ha ?1. As a result of the reduction of pesticide use intensity under Scenario 2, the consumption of fertilisers is also expected to decrease, yet not as much as pesticides (Figs. 2b and 2c).

Fig. 1. Impacts of pesticide use intensity reduction on the use of NPK fertilisers and expected profits from winter wheat in Latvia.

Explanation: This figure visualise data displayed in Table 1, showing how reduction in pesticide use intensity (horizontal lines on Figure a) will reduce target yields, which will lead to the reduction of fertiliser use (b, c) and reduction in profits (d). Red arrows are for the 1.35 kg ha ?1 limitation, red and black arrows — for the 0.78 kg ha ?1 limitation.. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

Under Scenario 1, an impact on profits is not expected, while under Scenario 2, the maximum profit would be on average 224 EUR ha ?1, which is significantly less (by 62%) than 587 EUR ha ?1 at a yield of 6 t ha ?1.

Winter rapeseed. Similar to the case of spring wheat, the reduction of pesticides use intensity to 1.35 kg ha ?1 of active substance for winter rapeseed would not affect the production of winter rapeseed (Fig. 3a). This means that in this case, neither the consumption of fertilisers nor farm profits decrease. However, the reduction of pesticide active substance use to 0.78 kg ha ?1 will have an impact.

Fig. 2. Impacts of pesticide use intensity reduction on the use of the NPK fertilisers for and expected profits from spring wheat in Latvia.

Explanation: This figure visualise data displayed in Table 1, showing how reduction in pesticide use intensity (horizontal lines on Figure a) will reduce target yields, which will lead to the reduction of fertiliser use (b, c) and reduction in profits (d).

Due to the reduced intensity of pesticide use under Scenario 2, the maximum target yield would decrease to 3 t ha ?1, which would also impact the usage of fertilisers and farm profits. Consequently, the maximum application rate of N fertiliser would decrease from 213 kg N ha ?1 to 142 kg N ha ?1. As a result of the reduced maximum yield, the anticipated profit would also diminish. In the case of no limitations on pesticide use, the yield of 5 t ha ?1 allows farmers to make a profit of 1671 EUR ha ?1, whereas in the case of limitations, the maximum expected yield of 3 t ha ?1 would allow farmers to earn an average profit of 860 EUR ha ?1 or 49% less. Scenario 3 assumes that, in addition to the 0.78 kg ha ?1 pesticide usage limitation, areas under conventionally produced wheat and winter rapeseed will be also reduced by 33%. It is expected that the farmers will switch wheat production from conventional to organic farming methods in the respective areas.

Fig. 3. Impacts of pesticide use intensity reduction on the use of NPK fertilisers for and expected profits from winter rapeseed in Latvia.

Explanation: This figure visualise data displayed in Table 1, showing how reduction in pesticide use intensity (horizontal lines on Figure a) will reduce target yields, which will lead to the reduction of fertiliser use (b, c) and reduction in profits (d).

Table 4 summarises the results of calculations on potential national-scale changes in the outputs of winter and spring wheat and winter rapeseed (based on average optimal crop production technologies models) in 2030 when implementing various scenarios for reducing pesticide use intensity, taking into account crop area distribution by yields (Table 2).

Comparing the base scenario, which uses the average optimal technology for producing the three main crops, with the scenario involving a reduction of pesticide use intensity to 1.35 kg ha ?1 (Scenario 1) reveals a 14% decrease in pesticide use and a 9% decrease in N fertiliser use. Additionally, the profit for agricultural producers from the three main crops would decrease by 7%, equivalent to EUR 22 mln. (Table 4).

Implementing pesticide use limitation to 0.78 kg ha ?1 (Scenario 2) will result in a significant reduction in overall pesticide use by 42% compared to the base level. Additionally, the use of N fertiliser will decrease by 18%, and farm profits will decline by 24%, equivalent to EUR 75 mln. (Table 4).

In Scenario 3, it is also anticipated that the use of pesticides will be reduced by 61%. At the same time, it would lead to a decrease in farmers’ profits by 41%. This scenario will meet the target of reducing overall pesticide use by 61% compared to the base scenario level (53% reduction from the 2015–2017 level).

5. Discussions
Our study results explain one of the main reasons behind the heated debate between policymakers and crop producers regarding the pesticide use reduction outlined in the EU From Farm to Fork strategy. From the perspective of crop producers and agronomists, who currently rely on well-established and scalable conventional crop production technologies, the financial implications of the pesticide use reduction could be substantial. A 40% reduction in profits could have dramatic consequences, not only for crop producers but for the entire agricultural sector. Many farms, especially those with loans, could face bankruptcy. And the overall impact could be far-reaching, also affecting production chains and rural communities. It is also expected that the overall wheat production will decrease by 32%, and rapeseed by 39%, which is notable, considering glo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Abstract
Purpose
The focus of this study was to evaluate the relationship between research publications in the pesticide field, a country’s gross domestic product (GDP) and GDP per capita. The study aims to analyze pesticide use in association with a country’s population and research publications. The purpose of this study is to uncover the country’s contribution to pesticide research and assess the financial resources allocated to it as a percentage of their GDP by exploring these factors.

Design/methodology/approach
The Web of Science database was used to retrieve data for the period of 2001–2020. The use of scientometric indicators allowed for the analysis of the collaborative patterns and active performance of countries in pesticide research. Socio-economic analysis was used to determine the contribution of countries toward pesticide research.

Findings
This study demonstrated a strong association (0.952%) between a country’s GDP and its research publications in the field of pesticide research. Countries, such as Denmark, Belgium and Australia, have benefited from global collaboration, which has enhanced their research efforts. Despite ranking lower in pesticide utilization, India focused on pesticide research, as indicated by its high publication/GDP per capita ratio (0.26).

Originality/value
Research on pesticides directly impacts agricultural practices, which, in turn, influence the economic production of the agricultural sector. Changes in pesticide usage can have inference for crop yields, food price and, eventually, the GDP. Comparative analysis can assist in evaluating the efficiency of regulatory policies in balancing ecological concerns with economic interests. Changes in regulations may impact both pesticide usage and economic outcomes.

1. Introduction
Scientific publications can be used as a valuable indicator of a nation’s progress in research and development in a particular field. Zainab et al. (2018) determined that a knowledge-based economy emphasizes the significance of research on its economic stability. There is a strong relationship between gross domestic product (GDP) and scientific productivity, which aids in analyzing the contribution of a country to the research and development of a particular field which is essential to make quality and revolutionary research.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the link between research productivity in the field of pesticides, GDP and GDP per capita and recommend ways to improve the research on pesticide literature. It also aims to analyze the usage of pesticides by population and their research productivity to determine the contribution of the country in a particular field. Pesticides play a significant role in safeguarding both agricultural and public health. It also protects plants against pests, human from diseases and vector borne illness such as malaria and dengue (Hernández et al., 2013; Nicolopoulou-Stamati et al., 2016; Warra and Prasad, 2020; Góngora-Echeverría et al., 2020; Hirt and Body-Malapel, 2020). Even though pesticides are mostly beneficial in modern agriculture, excessive use of chemicals exerts pollution in soil and the environment. It reduces the potential of hydrogen in soil which declines the productivity of crops is determined by Gupta et al. (2018) and Damalas and Koutroubas (2018).
Tremendous utilization of pesticide causes many human diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, dermatological, gastrointestinal, neurological, carcinogenic, reproductive, asthma, birth defects, hyperactivity disorder, autism, diabetes, respiratory diseases, obesity, organ diseases and system failures as represented by Yadav and Sehrawat (2011), Richardson et al. (2014), Benedetti et al. (2018), Marcelino et al. (2019) and also the reason for cancer was analyzed by Lentola et al. (2017), Niu et al. (2016), Valcke et al. (2017), Liu et al. (2020). Indication from several investigational studies proposes that the association between environmental exposures and various diseases highlights the comprehensive research in this field (Parrón et al., 2011, 2014; Li et al., 2021).
2. Literature study
2.1 Literature based on agriculture
A comprehensive study on assessment of scantiness in the European regulatory risk assessment for pesticides was carried out by Stehle and Schulz (2015) and highlights the failure to protect aquatic environments, spots the specific factors contributing to this stoppage, provides practical examples through case studies and calls for instant revisions and improvement measures to concentrate on the imperative issue of environmental risks that occur from agricultural insecticide utilization. The complication of interactions between pesticides in aquatic ecosystems and the significance of appraising the pragmatic pesticide mixtures and their potential impacts on different organisms within these ecosystems is found in the study of Pereira et al. (2017). The study of Lwoga et al. (2011) evaluated the convenience and utilization of agricultural knowledge and information in rural areas of Tanzania and emphasize the requirement for demand-driven and client-centric knowledge and information services in rural areas, serving as a model for make use of mixed methods in information behavior research.
The research accentuated by Patil et al. (2017) reveals the essential relations for creating effective environmental management tactics in agricultural areas and emphasize the challenges faced by agribusiness due to the exhaustion of natural resources such as land, water and the overall ecological quality. It underlines the execution of internet of things driven smart agribusiness practices as a method and technique to alleviate resource exhaustion, diminish costs and enhance productivity in the features of enduring challenges.
2.2 Literature based on gross domestic product and gross domestic product per capita
A study on the relationship between the accomplishment rate of assisted reproductive technology (ART) and national wealth was discussed by Dong et al. (2021). But this association becomes steady and reliable, once an assured economic threshold is reached. This finding endows valuable impending into the understanding of ART efficiency regarding a country’s financial grade.
A remarkable optimistic correlation between a country’s economic wealth measured by GDP per capita and the premature distribution of COVID-19 vaccinations was scrutinized by Dongarwar et al. (2021). This link emphasizes the importance of monetary factors in the worldwide vaccination efforts beside the epidemic and offers important insights for decision-makers and public health authorities in their vaccination tactics.
According to Memon et al. (2017) the discreet management of public debt is vital in promoting its allotment toward creative activities. It also investigated the envisaged per capita income to various economic measures, specifically total public debt, fiscal deficit, tax revenue and defense expenditure as a percentage of GDP, along with real GDP growth.
The associations between the total fertility rate (TFR), the utilization of ART and the GDP per capita in Europe were assessed by Lass and Lass (2021). It also revealed the utilization of ART in Europe is chiefly influenced by a nation’s economic prosperity rather than the TFR in that country. The accessibility and exploitation of ART treatment is significantly impacted by the wealth of a nation, with more affluent countries experiencing higher utilization rates. The implication of the study is that economic factors, such as the overall wealth and prosperity of a nation, have a stronger correlation with the adoption of assisted reproductive technologies than the natural fertility levels indicated by the TFR. Adambekov et al. (2016) investigate publication patterns in Central Asian countries, focusing on Kazakhstan, and explore factors influencing publication productivity. The results revealed that the number of publications is significantly associated with GDP and population size which represents there is a necessitate to regulate the research policy according to the factors.
A bibliometrics study was explored from the idea of Brüggmann et al. (2015), which encompassed various analyses comprising science mapping to synthesize previous research findings and guide upcoming research directions. This study also investigates the quantity and quality of new information and theoretical progressions to identify the most prolific scholars and institutions in the present research background (Elango and Rajendran, 2012; Singh, 2017; Nishavathi and Jeyshankar, 2017; Andreo-Martínez et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2020). Some of the popular ways of comparing countries involve economic, environmental, political and social indicators. In this study, economic factors were compared with the scientific productivity of top countries in pesticide research literature. GDP per capita emerged as a fitting indicator, shedding light on economic growth and its correlation with living standards over specific periods (Okhovati et al., 2015; Emami et al., 2018; Abati et al., 2021). Comprehensive analyses of the factors manipulate pesticide consumption, exploring economic, political and environmental dimensions. The findings divulge confirmation of pesticide under-use at low per capita GDP levels and probable overuse at higher income levels. It also explores correlation between these residuals and economic, political and agricultural variables that recognize noteworthy associations with foreign direct investment stock, farm size, mechanization and democracy (Ghimire and Woodward, 2013).
The ranking of countries was determined by their overall scientific output in the pesticide research area and evaluates their global share among small and large countries which may not produce an explored research in all circumstances. Hence it is vital to believe the financial metrics such as GDP and GDP per capita of the country in conjunction with scientific productivity. Studies (Basu, 2014) affirm the relevance of socio-economic indicators in understanding a country’s scientific productivity and its economic effectiveness. In subsequent chapters, an exhaustive examination of the materials and methodologies used is undertaken, accompanied by a careful elucidation of the software used for data analysis and interpretation. The analysis will have thorough discussions and make conclusive remarks that fulfill the strategic requirements of the objectives.
The study targeted to find the temporal evolution of research publication output of pesticides for the era of 2001–2020:

to explore the collaborative pattern and International Scientific Collaboration of world literature on pesticide research;

to determine the research impact of the publications using citation measures;

to evaluate the GDP and GDP per capita of the countries;

to resolve the correlation between productivity and GDP; and

to identify the correlation between top 20 prolific countries in utilization of pesticide with population and productivity.

3. Methodology
3.1 Data collection
For data assessment, Web of Science and Scopus are widely regarded as the most comprehensive platforms for data retrieval and journal ranking based on productivity and total citations received (Chadegani et al., 2013). This study specifically used the Web of Science database for extracting data for the period of 20?years (2001–2020). A total of 10,389 records were used for analysis. The search strategy involved using the keyword “Pesticide” in the Medical Subject Headings and identifying related terms associated with pesticides such as “Pesticides”, “Toxicity”, “Fungicide”, “Herbicides”, “Insecticides”, “Insect Repellents” and “Rodenticides” were used with appropriate Boolean operators in the database for comprehensive data collection. This study explored the association between economic indicators such as GDP and GDP per capita of countries with their scientific productivity. This correlation aimed to illuminate the efficiency of each country. The application of socioeconomic indicators in determining a country’s economic efficiency has been validated by prior studies (Basu, 2014).
3.2 Materials and methods
Bibliographical details related to the study were retrieved from the Web of Science database as total of 10,508 documents and 119 records are out of the study period are considered as duplicates, hence only 10,389 articles were downloaded in plain text format, encompassing information on citations, bibliographic details, abstracts, keywords, and cited references. The researcher used various software tools for data analysis. Bibexcel, as recognized by Mao et al. (2018), and Biblioshiny, facilitated the initial exploration of the retrieved data. Visualization tools such as VOS-viewer presented by Zhou et al. (2018) and Martinho (2019) were used to enhance the understanding of data patterns. This analysis was based on production and the proportion of production, incorporating these factors with the GDP and GDP Per Capita data obtained from the World Bank.
The data derivation and cleaning process are elucidated in Figure 1, outlining the study’s data structure is revealed in Figure 2.
4. Results
Temporal evolution of scientific productivity on pesticide research literature. Figure 3 illustrates the temporal evolution of scientific productivity in pesticide research literature and its impact which represents that the growth of literature shows an exponential growth (0.9838) for the study period. This sustained increase in productivity signifies the substantial contributions of countries to pesticide research (Skevas and Lansink, 2014). The citation reached its utmost in the year 2011 with 19,346 citations. The rise in scientific productivity reflects global awareness of the complicated utilization of pesticides. In the middle of the study period citation was high and in early period citations was medium and in the later period it was low which depicts the recent publications are yet to be cited and in the middle period concentration toward pesticide research is higher than that in early period.
Perceptive of global productivity trends. During the period 2001–2020, the USA emerged as the leading country in terms of pesticide research publications. When evaluating its productivity share globally, it displayed a decreasing trend. These multi-layered elements cooperatively shape the research landscape within a country, impacting its global standing in scientific productivity are represented in Figure 4.
In contrast, China secured the second position and exhibited a reliable increase in its world productivity share, rising from 1.85% to 13.72%. The prominent surge in research output can be attributed to several factors as the Chinese Government’s emphasis on scientific research and innovation, especially in integrating advanced technology in agriculture substantial investments in recent years and active participation in international collaborative networks. These elements have propelled China’s contributions to pesticide research significantly.

Countries such as Spain, France, Germany and the UK, all ranking within the top 20, demonstrated a steady increase in productivity but a shifting trend persist in their global productivity shares. To further enhance their scientific contributions, these nations should prioritize agricultural research and development on pesticide research. Such investments are crucial for amplifying scientific publications in pesticide research field, thereby nurturing advancements in agriculture and pest management practices.

Active performance of countries in the pesticide research literature. Activity index (AI) offers valuable insights into countries’ publication profiles in the pesticide research field is demonstrated in Table 1. In the top 20 countries USA, Spain, India, Italy, Canada, UK, Germany, Japan, Australia and Denmark displayed remarkable dedication to pesticide research with more than 100 in their mean AI score. It indicates that these countries possess vigorous research infrastructures, driving significant advancements in scientific understanding and innovation within pesticide-related domains (Lancho-Barrantes and Cantu-Ortiz, 2020).
Conversely, several countries fell below the global average, experiencing a consistent decrease in research efforts over the block periods. This decline suggests a diminishing focus on pesticide research in these nations. Countries such as China, Brazil, Iran, Argentina and Mexico showed a steady amplify in research efforts across the five-year block periods but their mean values remained relatively low. The Research Specialization Index (RSI) values for these top 20 countries as 0.99–1 indicates their active engagement and performance exceeding the global average in the pesticide research field.

4.1 Collaborative pattern of countries in the research fields of pesticide literature
A total of 141 countries actively contributed to the research output in pesticide literature during this timeframe is used in Table 2 and Figure 5. The major research of (40% and 33%) was domestically collaborated within single countries during the first decade. But, during the subsequent periods, this trend shifted, with single-country collaborations falling to the second and third positions. Collaboration between two countries emerged prominently, accounting for over 30% of the total research output in the first three five-year blocks and a quarter of output in the last block period. Simultaneously, collaborations involving three or more countries exhibited a stable increase over these block periods.
The decline in domestic collaboration is equivalent to the rise in collaboration involving multiple countries. This trend indicates a shift in research priorities and funding, favoring international collaborations. International collaborations offer researchers to combine resources and expertise, leading to more efficient and productive research outcomes. Countries with high productivity in the field are collaborated with other countries to share knowledge, information and resources, enabling them to remain competitive and enhance their contributions to the field of pesticide research (Zyoud et al., 2016).
4.2 Collaborative indices in pesticide research
Table 3 and Figure 6 provide a detailed overview of the degree of collaboration and other international scientific collaborative indices in the field of pesticide research. These indices shed light on the extent of global collaboration and its impact on scientific progress.
In terms of the Degree of Collaboration Index, Turkey (1.37) holds the highest position, indicating a predominantly local collaboration trend in their publications. This is followed by Iran (1.33), the UK (1.29) and India (1.25). These figures suggest that these countries have a strong emphasis on local collaborations within their scientific community.

International research collaborations significantly contribute to the advancement of knowledge, professionalization and specialization in science. Belgium leads the International Collaboration Index (ICI) due to its substantial engagement in research collaborations with other countries, despite being a high-income nation. On the contrary, Turkey exhibits the lowest ICI at 0.18, indicating limited international collaborations.

The internalization index (II) reveals that 81% of Denmark’s publications primarily involve international collaborations. This high II value highlights Denmark’s proactive approach to collaborating with other countries, indicating a strong preference for international partnerships to enhance their research and development initiatives in the pesticide research domain. Furthermore, the science production index of Canada, being smaller than India’s, suggests that scientists from smaller countries tend to collaborate more internationally than domestically, emphasizing the global nature of scientific collaborations in pesticide research (Elango and Rajendran, 2012).
4.3 Citation impact on pesticide research output with publication efficiency
Table 4 provides an insightful analysis of the impact of pesticide research publications over different time periods, focusing on the publication efficiency index (PEI), mean total citations per article, mean annual citation and the citations per paper (CPP).
From 2001 to 2012, the PEI value exceeded 1, indicating that the impact of publications outweighed the research efforts invested during those years. Conversely, from 2014 to 2020, the PEI value dropped below 1, suggesting that the impact of publications was comparatively lower than the dedicated research efforts in those years. This shift highlights a change in the effectiveness of research output over time.

Analyzing the mean total citations for each article, the peak occurred in 2001 with an average of 68.32 citations. This higher citation rate can be attributed to papers published two decades ago, allowing more time for citations to accumulate. In contrast, the mean annual citation reached its highest point in 2020, averaging 6.05 citations per year. This increase aligns with the rise in the number of publications during this period. Overall, the average total citation per record stood at 713, while the average total citation per year was 76. Regarding CPP, the highest values were observed in the early years, gradually declining in later years (Sandler and Gladyrev, 2020).
4.4 Comparison of pesticide utilization with population and research publications
Table 5 illustrates the significant differences in pesticide usage among countries, with China leading the way by using an extensive 1,76,3000 million tons of pesticides. Following China are the USA (4,07,779 tons) and Brazil (3,77,176 tons). These high levels of pesticide usage are primarily driven by the need to sustain vast populations and ensure continuous food supply, crop protection and increased agricultural yields. Economic factors, including production costs, market demand and prices, intricately influence pesticide usage in these countries (Simonova, 2019).
China, with its substantial pesticide usage, dominates the world’s productive share, accounting for 42.86% of global pesticides. However, its research productivity (15.85%) is comparatively lower than that of the USA (22.52%). This discrepancy is due to the USA’s robust research infrastructure, prominent research institutions, universities and a large research and development sector. These factors have facilitated increased funding for research on pesticides and related agricultural topics.

India, the second most populous country, uses 52,750 tons of pesticides, constituting 1.27% of the global share. Despite its relatively lower pesticide usage, India ranks eighth in the world research output, contributing 4.56% to the global research share. This suggests that India is conscientious about the impact of pesticides and has a focus on biodegradable organic fertilizers, indicating a shift toward environmentally friendly agricultural practices.

In contrast, countries such as Ecuador and South Africa have higher pesticide consumption but significantly lower production of pesticide research literature. The correlation between population and pesticide usage shows an optimistic association with 68% of correlation, portray that highly populated countries are using more pesticides to increase their food productivity and also the association between productivity and pesticide usage depicts a positive relation with 64% of correlation which represents the high utilization of pesticide leads to more research.

4.5 Prolific countries based on their income group
Countries’ research outputs on pesticides are scrutinized through the lens of their economic capacities. High-income countries, constituting 56.46% of the total, typically boast ample resources allocated for research and development is expressed in Figure 7. These resources include advanced research infrastructure, cutting-edge equipment and a pool of well-educated and trained researchers. Consequently, high-income countries have the means to use sophisticated research methods in studying pesticides, leading to comprehensive and innovative research outcomes.
In contrast, upper middle-income (UMC) countries (27.90%) and lower middle-income (LMC) countries (8.65%) often encounter challenges related to funding and political support for pesticide research. Limited resources can impede the scope and depth of research initiatives. To overcome these challenges, countries in the UMC and LMC categories frequently engage in collaborations with high-income and upper middle-income countries. By partnering with economically stronger nations, these countries can enhance their research productivity in the field of pesticide research.

Among the top 20 most productive countries in pesticide research, China, Brazil, Mexico and Turkey fall under the upper middle-income (UMI) category, and India is the only lower middle-income (LMI) country within this group. The remaining countries are high-income (HI) nations.

4.6 Socio-economic analysis of most prolific countries in the field of pesticide research
Table 6 presents a detailed socio-economic analysis of prolific countries in the field of pesticides, highlighting the relationship between their GDP and pesticide research publications. The data reveals intriguing patterns regarding the concentration and priorities of these countries in pesticide research (Memon et al., 2017). The USA with the highest GDP of US$20.94tn, ranks 19th when comparing publications with GDP. This demonstrates a lower focus on pesticide research, indicating that they are concentrating in other research than in pesticide.
In contrast, Iran, with the lowest GDP of US$0.19tn, displays the highest average of 1594.74 pesticide research publications per GDP in trillion US$. Despite limited economic resources, Iran emphasizes pesticide research, indicating a significant commitment to this field. Denmark, with a GDP of US$0.35tn, secures the second position in publications per GDP, demonstrating a notable dedication to pesticide research despite its economic size. Japan, with a GDP of US$4.98tn, scores the lowest in publication/GDP ratio, signifying a lower interest in pesticide research literature and a least awareness about pesticide utilization. Australia, Denmark and Belgium are high-income nations showing zero publications/GDP per capita, indicating a lack of focus on pesticide research. Despite economic affluence, these countries may be overlooking the environmental and agricultural impacts of pesticides. In contrast, low-income agricultural country India prioritizes pesticide research, topping publications/GDP per capita at US$0.26, showcasing a practical approach within limited financial means. China, a major pesticide consumer, faces challenges in balancing agricultural needs and a large population, resulting in substantial pesticide usage (Ghimire and Woodward, 2013).
4.7 Gross domestic product vs total productivity
Figure 8 and Table 7 describes the GDP versus total productivity of the 20 most prolific countries in pesticide research output. The Pearson Correlation of 0.952 and R2 value of 0.9066 designate the positive correlation between GDP and research publications as above average among the 20 most prolific countries in pesticide research output. At the onset, the countries disseminated around the trend line demonstrate that the 20 most prolific countries were equally proportionate to their economic size. The USA has a higher publication rate but is far away from the regression line. Iran is the only country where the output is directly related to economic size. Denmark, Argentina, Spain, Brazil, Canada, France, Japan and India were also close to the curve but they are slightly lower for their sizes, with China fairly below the regression line (Dong et al., 2021).
Table 8 interprets a strong relationship between the predictor variable, GDP and the dependent variable, publication through the regression analysis. The F-statistic (174.633) tests the overall significance of the regression model, and the associated p-value (0.000) specifies that the model is statistically significant. This recommends that the difference in publication can be effectively explained by changes in GDP. Verifying the coefficients, the intercept (constant) is 224.113 and for each unit of augmentation in GDP, publication is also predicted to augment by 97.508 units. Both the constant and GDP coefficients are statistically significant, sustained by low p-values (0.000). The standardized coefficient for GDP is 0.952, signifying a strong positive impact on publication. The 95% confidence intervals for the coefficients present a range within which can logically expect the true coefficients to fall.

5. Discussion and conclusion
This study was performed to analyze the expansion of research on pesticide literature during the period 2001–2020. Totally 10,508 documents were retrieved from the Web of Science and 119 records are out of the study period are considered as duplicates; hence only 10,389 documents were used in this study, it shows that research with the subject of pesticide has increased every year and attained its highest citation in 2001 is related with (de Castilhos Ghisi et al., 2020; Skevas and Lansink, 2014). After 2009 the publication of pesticides reached its peak and this phenomenon happened due to a blend of social, economic, technological and environmental factors. This collective awareness has significantly augmented the continuous growth observed in pesticide research publications in recent years. The USA is the highest producer of pesticide research publications but compared with global productivity it was low, this shows the lack of focus in this particular research collaboration strategies or regulatory frameworks or funding allocation in evolving research trends and resource availability.
Countries such as China, Brazil, Iran, Argentina and Mexico showed a stable increase in research in the five-year block periods but their mean values remained low. This fact depicts that research efforts being dispersed across a wide array of agricultural and scientific areas, rather than being concentrated on pesticide research alone. Concerning CPP the highest values were experiential in the premature years, gradually declining in later years. This decline is likely due to recent publications that have not yet been extensively cited, indicating that the impact of more recent research is still in the process of being recognized and disseminated within the scientific community.

The utmost citation has been secured by 2011 with 19,346 citations and according to publication; the year 2020 has more documents but yet to be cited since of recent publication (Konur, 2017). The PEI depicts the impacts of publications are more than the research effort dedicated to it for the years 2001–2013. When comparing the longitudinal productivity and world share of publications of the 20 most prolific countries, there was an uninterrupted elevation in publications but analyzing the productivity with world share there has been a fluctuating trend monitored. The country USA (1882) has the highest productivity but while equating to world productivity (35.52–13.56), it declined. By conflictingly China has attained second position in productivity with 1,425 documents and showed an increasing trend (1.85–13.72) in equating with world productivity. RSI represented that the presentation of productive countries is energetic and greater than average in the research field. The size of the country and their collaboration are compared in the II which represents that smaller countries have collaborated internationally and some countries prefer most of their publications locally.
The smaller countries such as Denmark (177 out of 218), Belgium (141 out of 197) and Australia (207 out of 304) prefer international collaboration which enhances research and development. The country with the highest population consumes more pesticides to preserve the food products that have to be supplied to the whole country for the whole year and to evade the scarceness and inadequacy of food.

"Abstract

The two main types of cholinesterases, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), share similar structures and functions and are commonly present in biological environments. The activity of cholinesterase is closely related to pesticide residues; it is crucial to develop enzyme-inhibition-based fluorescent probes for pesticide residue detection. However, the discovery of a fluorescent probe that selectively targets one of these is consistently a formidable challenge. In this study, two kinds of fluorescent probes, HBT-A and HBT-B, were developed with 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazole (HBT) as the fluorophore, which can selectively distinguish AChE and BChE, respectively. Our probes (HBT-A for AChE and HBT-B for BChE) exhibited high sensitivity and specificity toward their respective analytes in cells and zebrafish. Finally, we used HBT-B as an example and demonstrated that it can be an effective tool for visualizing pesticide residues in living organisms, highlighting the potential application of the developed probes in environmental monitoring and food safety.

Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Cholinesterases (ChE) are a class of essential glycoproteins that play extremely important roles in various physiological events, including neuromuscular transmission, cognitive function, and detoxification. The two main forms of cholinesterases, acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC 3.1.1.7) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE, EC 3.1.1.8), share similar structures and functions and are present in various tissues. (1) AChE is primarily found in neuromuscular tissues and regulates the activity of the cholinergic nervous system, while BChE is mainly distributed in blood and liver and is associated with many kinds of human health problems, including Alzheimer’s disease, toxic substances (organophosphate and carbamate pesticides) poisoning, and drug metabolism. (2?6) Therefore, the reliable determination of the ChE activity is of great significance for drug discovery, early diagnosis of ChE-related diseases, and pesticide residue monitoring.
Pesticides, which were originally designed as compounds that are harmful to pests, played an important role in public health and agricultural production. However, the improper or excessive use of pesticides such as organophosphorus, carbamate, and pyrethroid, causing excessive pesticides in food and water, which currently causes health-related problems and environmental destruction all over the world, (7?11) has promoted the development of pesticide residue testing methods. (12?14) Traditional assays such as mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and chromatography have been widely used to evaluate pesticide residues. (15?20) However, these methods are often time-consuming and expensive and require sophisticated equipment and highly skilled operators. In contrast, UV/vis assays (also named Ellman’s assay) and fluorometric assays offer several advantages over traditional methods, (21?25) including high throughput format and real-time monitoring capabilities. Despite UV/vis assays being relatively simple and cost-effective, they are two-step assays, and the sensitivity is not sufficient. Moreover, these methods can not distinguish between AChE and BChE, highlighting the urgent need for more sensitive and selective detection methods.
To address this issue, a fluorescent probe-based assay has emerged as a promising alternative for sensing and imaging cholinesterases, due to its high sensitivity and selectivity, simple operation, fast response speed, and good stability. (26?42) Some excellent works about the detection of the AChE (43?45) and BChE (46?48) and the discovery of cholinesterase inhibitors (49?51) have been reported. However, designing specific probes for distinguishing between AChE and BChE is very challenging. Our study presents two novel cholinesterase-specific fluorescent probes, HBT-A and HBT-B, developed by using 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazole (HBT) as the fluorophore. Considering the natural substrate acetylcholine of AChE, the acetyl group was chosen as the recognition group for AChE. Meanwhile, the cyclopropyl group, which we had previously reported as a recognition group, (52) was used for BChE’s sensing in this work. The fluorophore and recognition group were conjugated by an ester bond, which could be hydrolyzed by cholinesterases. HBT-A and HBT-B can selectively distinguish and respond to AChE and BChE, respectively, exhibiting high sensitivity and specificity toward their respective analytes (Scheme 1). We demonstrated the excellent imaging capabilities of both probes at the cellular and zebrafish levels. Moreover, we showed that HBT-B can be an effective tool for visualizing pesticide residues in living organisms, highlighting its potential application in environmental monitoring and biomedical research. Overall, our study presents a valuable tool for rapid, sensitive, and selective pesticide residue detection.

Kinetic Assays
Each experiment of this study was repeated three times, and the results were compliant with statistical rules. For the absorption and fluorescence spectra of both probes (HBT-A and HBT-B), the test solutions and procedures were performed as follows. First, an appropriate amount of the compound was dissolved in DMSO and kept as the stock solution (10 mM) in a 1.5 mL brown EP tube. Second, 10 ?L of the probe stock solution (10 mM) was added to 90 ?L of DMSO solution to prepare a 100 ?L solution (1 mM). Third, the above probe solution (1 mM) was diluted with 990 ?L of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH = 7.4) to obtain a 1 mL test solution (10 ?M). Lastly, 200 ?L of the probe (10 ?M) with or without the target enzyme (10 ?g/mL) was added to the microplate for fluorescence detection.
For the selectivity experiments, test solutions of enzymes (1 ?g/mL), such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), trypsin, carboxylesterase 1 (CE1), carboxylesterase 2 (CE2), chymotrypsin, nitroreductase (NTR), and ?-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), were prepared using the same procedure. The change of fluorescence intensity for each probe (?ex = 325 nm, ?em = 460 nm) was determined in the absence and presence of different enzymes. Limit of detection (LOD) experiments were performed using the reported general formula to calculate the LOD. Kinetics of enzyme-catalyzed studies were performed according to a previous report using a similar method. (53?55)
Cell Culture and Live Imaging
PC-12 and OLN93 cells were purchased from Procell Life Science and Technology Co., Ltd. (Wuhan, China). All the cells maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gibco, USA) were seeded on a confocal dish (NEST) and further incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h. The cells were then pretreated with inhibitors for 2 h before incubating with 10 ?M probes. Nuclear Red LCS1, a well-known fluorescent dye (?ex = 622 nm, ?em = 645 nm), is localized to the nucleus and can be used for fluorescence imaging. After binding to DNA in living cells, the red fluorescence is significantly enhanced. Therefore, imaging was performed after 10 ?M Nuclear Red LCS1 was incubated with the cells away from light. After that the cells were imaged using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX71, Japan). Five-day-old zebrafish were obtained from Shanghai FishBio Co., Ltd., and the live imaging was carried out according to the previous report. (53?55)

Design and Optical Characterization of Fluorogenic Probes
In this study, 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazole (HBT) was selected as the fluorophore due to its biocompatibility and large Stokes shift. In continuation of our previous work, (28) the title fluorogenic probes were designed by conjugating the HBT fluorophore and the recognition group with an ester bond. The recognition groups of the probes were designed by mimicking natural substrates and progressively optimized by manipulating the structural differences between the probes for the AChE and BChE active pockets. The steric size of the recognition groups directly affects the binding of the probes in the active cavity of the enzyme, which, in turn, determines the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Therefore, inspired from the natural substrate (acetylcholine) of AChE, the acetyl group was chosen as the recognition group for AChE. Meanwhile, the cyclopropyl group, which had been previously reported as a recognition group, (52) was used for BChE’s sensing in this work. Two probes, HBT-A and HBT-B, were developed, and the sensing mechanism is shown in Scheme 1. Both of the probes were chemically synthesized and fully characterized (Figures S1–S7).
Next, the optical properties of both probes were studied step-by-step. Following a previously reported method, (28) it was pleasing to find that both probes, HBT-A and HBT-B, had a weak background signal of fluorescence (?ex = 325 nm), while the probes showed a significant enhancement at 460 nm upon the addition of ChEs (Figure S8). The pH dependence study suggested that both probes were very stable in a broad pH range (pH 5.0–9.0). To our delight, the fluorescence intensity of the probes reached a maximum around the physiological pH value (pH = 7.4). Thus, PBS buffer with a physiological pH value (pH = 7.4) was selected as the test condition for optical characterization (Figure S9). The simulated binding modes of both probes in the enzyme active sites were obtained by molecular docking, which revealed discrimination over two kinds of ChEs (Figure S10). To determine whether HBT-A and HBT-B could be specifically hydrolyzed by ChEs, we conducted selectivity tests for the common hydrolases. The breaking of the ester bond within the probe was accompanied by changes in fluorescence intensity (FI). The linear changes of FI over time (?F/?t) indicated the hydrolysis rate at the early stage of the enzymatic reaction. Therefore, the ?F/?t value of the tested probe when recognizing these enzymes represents the catalytic activity of the enzyme against this probe, further reflecting the selectivity of the probes. As shown in Figures 1a and 1d, probe HBT-A showed excellent specificity toward AChE, while HBT-B exhibited high specificity for BChE, indicating that both probes can distinguish two forms of ChEs well. The experimental observation was in good agreement with our expectation.

(b and e) Fluorescence emission spectra (?ex = 325 nm) of HBT-A (10 ?M) and HBT-B (10 ?M) with the incubation of various concentrations of analytes at 30 °C. (c and f) Michaelis–Menten curve for AChE (1 ?g/mL) or BChE (5 ?g/mL) catalysis against HBT-A (c) or HBT-B (f) in PBS buffer at 30 °C.

Thereafter, the time-dependent and dose-dependent experiments of HBT-A and HBT-B were performed to indirectly reflect the reaction progress of the system by monitoring the changes in FI. Upon the addition of 1 ?g/mL AChE, the fluorescence of HBT-A rapidly increased and reached a plateau within 15 min, while the fluorescence of HBT-B increased after the addition of 10 ?g/mL BChE (Figures S11a and S11b). Furthermore, the fluorescence intensity of the probes increased with the analyte dose and exhibited a linear correlation between 0 and 0.5 ?g/mL AChE (Figures 1b and S11c) and 0–7 ?g/mL BChE (Figures 1e and S11d). The LOD of HBT-A for AChE was calculated to be about 9.4 ng/mL, suggesting that the sensitivity of this probe was superior to that of the previous studies, (55) while the LOD of HBT-B for BChE was around 340 ng/mL (Table S1).
Michaelis–Menten Kinetics
To further explore the enzyme-catalyzed kinetics for each of the two probes, the Michaelis–Menten curves for the AChE-catalyzed hydrolysis of HBT-A and BChE-catalyzed hydrolysis of HBT-B were obtained, respectively (Figures 1c and 1f). Generally, the kinetics were determined by changing the substrate concentration to measure the reaction rate for each pair of enzyme–substrate. Consequently, the Michaelis constant (Km) and the maximum reaction speed (Vmax) for HBT-A were obtained as ?14.43 and 1.82 ?M/min, respectively, and the Km and Vmax for HBT-B were obtained as ?23.71 and ?0.49 ?M/min, respectively. Of note, the developed probe shows comparable kinetic properties, based on the comparison of HBT-A and HBT-B with the reported fluorescent probes of AChE and BChE (Table S1). These results suggested that probes HBT-A and HBT-B demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity for rapidly sensing AChE and BChE, respectively.
Imaging in Living Cells and Zebrafish
To investigate the biocompatibility of the developed probes, we performed fluorescent imaging in PC-12 cells with HBT-A and OLN93 cells with HBT-B. It has been reported that PC12 cells are rich in AChE activity, making them a satisfactory cell model for AChE detection. (56) Before the live cell imaging, we checked their cytotoxicity against those cells and found that they showed no significant influence on the normal growth of cells for 24 h. As shown in Figure 2, the fluorescent signals of PC-12 cells and OLN93 cells gradually increased when they were treated with the corresponding fluorogenic probes. It is worth mentioning that the fluorescence enhancement is well dependent on the incubation time and the dosages of the probes and mainly distributed in the cytoplasm (Figures S12–S15). This observation suggests that both HBT-A and HBT-B demonstrate the capability to be further applied in living systems.

(g) Fluorescence images of OLN93 cells incubated with different concentrations of HBT-B (2, 5, 7, 10, and 15 ?M) for 50 min. (b, d, f, and h) Relative intensities of the corresponding fluorescence images in panels (a, c, e, and g), respectively (imaged with a WU channel (?ex = 330–385 nm, ?em ? 420 nm). Scale bar = 50 ?m, all the experiments were repeated at least three times).

To determine the specific response of the probes to cholinesterase in vivo, a series of experiments were conducted. The cells under investigation were subjected to pretreatment with various inhibitors, namely, donepezil (an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, AChE), iso-OMPA (an inhibitor of butyrylcholinesterase, BChE), and tacrine (an inhibitor of both AChE and BChE). Subsequently, the cells were incubated with the probes for a duration of 30 min and were imaged accordingly. The obtained results, as depicted in Figure 3a, illustrated a significant decrease in the fluorescence signal of PC-12 cells when they were incubated with HBT-A after preincubation with either the AChE inhibitor or the ChEs inhibitor. Conversely, it was observed that the BChE inhibitor did not elicit a decrease in fluorescence. In contrast, Figure 3b demonstrates that the fluorescence signal of OLN93 cells incubated with HBT-B was markedly diminished upon preincubation with either the BChE inhibitor or the ChEs inhibitor, while the AChE inhibitor did not yield any noticeable increase in fluorescence.

To further evaluate the efficacy of HBT-A and HBT-B in an in vivo setting, zebrafish were utilized as the experimental model. As depicted in Figures 3e and 3f, robust fluorescence signals were observed in the abdomen of zebrafish treated separately with HBT-A and HBT-B, separately. Zebrafish treated solely with the probe were assigned as the control group (referred to as NC). Consistent with the findings from cell-based imaging, pretreatment with tacrine (a well-known ChEs inhibitor) resulted in a significant reduction in green fluorescence in zebrafish treated with either HBT-A or HBT-B. Conversely, the administration of donepezil led to a decrease in the fluorescence signal originating from HBT-A, while iso-OMPA exclusively reduced the fluorescence signal stemming from HBT-B. The combined results obtained from cellular and zebrafish imaging provided compelling evidence that HBT-A and HBT-B exhibited specific responsiveness toward AChE and BChE in an in vivo context, respectively.
Application in Pesticide Detection
The underlying principle of enzyme-inhibition-based biosensors for pesticide detection lies in the ability of pesticides to inhibit specific enzymes, thereby impeding the catalysis of their respective substrates. Consequently, the inhibition of enzyme activity induced by pesticides indirectly results in alterations in the optical or electrical signals generated by the biosensor. ChEs, critical enzymes involved in biological nerve conduction, are prime targets for organophosphorus and carbamate pesticides. In addition, it revealed that the activity of fish ChEs was significantly reduced after the treatment of pyrethroid pesticides. (57) Considering the wider active site of BChE should enable the accommodation of broader spectrum of pesticide, the BChE probe HBT-B was employed to assess its capability to detect pesticide residues within complicated biological samples.
To assess the ability of HBT-B to detect pesticide residues in organisms, an initial examination was conducted using living cells. OLN93 cells were pretreated with 50 ?M concentrations of various pesticides, namely dipterex, carbaryl, or deltamethrin, for a duration of 30 min. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with 10 ?M HBT-B for an additional 30 min. As depicted in Figures 4a and 4b, only the cells treated with the probe exhibited a strong fluorescence signal, while the fluorescence of cells incubated with pesticides notably decreased. These results indicated that the HBT-B probe possesses the ability to sensitively and reliably detect organophosphorus, carbamate, and pyrethroid pesticides. Consequently, the cell-based imaging outcomes suggest the potential of HBT-B as a reliable tool for indicating the presence of these pesticides at complicated samples.

(a and c) Fluorescence images of OLN93 cells (a) or zebrafish (c) treated with 10 ?M HBT-B for 30 min in the presence and absence of pretreatment of pesticides (dipterex, carbaryl, and deltamethrin; 50 ?M for cells and 100 ?M for zebrafish) for 30 min. (b and d) The relative pixel intensity measurements from images (a and c) (imaged with a WU channel (?ex = 330–385 nm, ?em ? 420 nm). Scale bar of cell = 50 ?m and scale bar of zebrafish = 1 mm, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001; statistical analyses were performed using an independent samples t test with equal variances, means ± s.d., n = 3 independent experiments.

Thereafter, fluorescence imaging of zebrafish treated with the HBT-B probe in the presence and absence of pesticides was conducted. Similar to the cell experiments, zebrafish were exposed to HBT-B (10 ?M) for 30 min, with or without prior pretreatment with 100 ?M concentrations of pesticides (dipterex, carbaryl, and deltamethrin) for 30 min. Gratifyingly, as anticipated, zebrafish that were pretreated with any of the aforementioned pesticides exhibited significantly lower fluorescence signals compared to the control group (NC) (Figures 4c and 4d). The imaging data obtained from both cellular and zebrafish experiments collectively demonstrated that HBT-B can be considered to be an exceptional visualization tool for monitoring pesticide residues in living organisms.
In conclusion, we present the development of HBT-based fluorescent probes, namely, HBT-A and HBT-B, which are capable of distinguishing AChE and BChE, respectively. Both probes demonstrated excellent sensitivity and specificity to detect their respective analytes (HBT-A for AChE and HBT-B for BChE), which were well-proven through cellular and zebrafish imaging experiments. Furthermore, we applied HBT-B as a visual tool in detecting pesticide residues in both cellular and zebrafish models. The results unequivocally demonstrated that HBT-B can reliably indicate the presence of organophosphorus, carbamate, and pyrethroid pesticides in living organisms. Overall, this research highlights the potential of HBT-based probes as valuable tools for enzyme-specific imaging and monitoring of pesticide residues in biological systems.
